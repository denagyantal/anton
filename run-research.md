# Quick Start - Running the Research Team

## Option 1: Run All Agents (Full Sweep)

Open this file in Claude and say:

> Run all 4 research agents (Reddit Scanner, HN & Indie Hackers, Competitor Analyst, Trend Spotter), then evaluate the results with the Idea Evaluator. Save all outputs to the ideas/ folder with today's date.

## Option 2: Run Individual Agents

### Reddit Scanner
> Read `agents/reddit-scanner.md` and execute the research. Focus on [CATEGORY]. Save to `ideas/raw/reddit-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### HN & Indie Hackers
> Read `agents/hn-indiehackers.md` and execute the research. Focus on [CATEGORY]. Save to `ideas/raw/hn-indiehackers-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### Competitor Analysis
> Read `agents/competitor-analyst.md` and analyze [SPECIFIC NICHE]. Save to `ideas/raw/competitor-analysis-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### Trend Spotter
> Read `agents/trend-spotter.md` and find current trends. Save to `ideas/raw/trends-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### Evaluate Ideas
> Read `agents/idea-evaluator.md` and score all ideas in `ideas/raw/`. Save to `ideas/evaluated/`

## Option 3: Focused Research

> Research SaaS ideas specifically in the [NICHE] space. Use all agents but narrow the focus to [NICHE]. Evaluate and give me the top 3 opportunities.
