# Simple Bookkeeping / QBO Alternative — Score: 75/105

**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-24

## Summary
AI-first bookkeeping for non-accountants: connect bank feeds, AI auto-categorizes transactions, plain-English dashboard ("You made $12,400 this month"), one-click tax-ready reports. No accounting jargon. Think "Mint for business." $79-99 LTD.

## Market Data
- **Target**: QBO has 7M+ subscribers. Prices up 125% since 2017. 33M+ small businesses
- **Key Pain**: "Simple tasks take too many steps" in QBO. Many still use spreadsheets
- **Competitors**: Xero ($15-78/mo), Wave (free), FreshBooks ($19-60/mo)

## Risks
- Wave is free — hard to compete
- Xero is good and growing
- Bank connection (Plaid) costs may erode LTD margins
- Better verticalized: "QuickBooks for plumbers" > generic QBO alternative
