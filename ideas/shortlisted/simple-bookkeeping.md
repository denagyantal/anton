## Top 3 Risks

1. Competing with free (Wave) and dominant (QBO) is extremely difficult

## Verdict

EXPLORE FURTHER (high risk, high reward) -- Massive market with real frustration, but competing against free and dominant players is the hardest fight. Best angle may be vertical-specific ("QuickBooks for plumbers") rather than generic.
