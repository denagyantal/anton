| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | ZenMaid, BookingKoala/Launch27, Swept all validate market. $90B industry. Reddit threads with 22+ answers on automation needs. r/CleaningBusiness has 35K+ members actively discussing software. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | BookingKoala charges $395/mo and "feels half-baked." ZenMaid has per-cleaner pricing. Swept is commercial-only. No tool handles recurring schedules + per-room checklists + auto-invoicing well. Fragmented market with no dominant affordable winner. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $69-129 LTD is very profitable. Simple infrastructure (scheduling, checklists, invoicing). Cleaning businesses are cost-sensitive and LTD-loving. r/CleaningBusiness regularly discusses software costs. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | No major free-tier competitor in cleaning-specific software. Yardbook is free but for landscaping. Cleaning business owners expect to pay for scheduling tools. |

| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Good SEO: "cleaning business software", "maid service scheduling app", "Airbnb cleaning management", "ZenMaid alternative". "How to start a cleaning business" content drives massive traffic. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Cleaning business owners are active deal-seekers. Less likely on AppSumo than tech founders, but combined AppSumo + cleaning community marketing would work well. |

| **TOTAL** | | | **80/105** | |

## Next Steps

1. Decide sub-segment focus: residential maid service vs. Airbnb turnover cleaning vs. commercial janitorial (recommend Airbnb turnover -- most underserved, clear workflow)
2. Validate with 10 cleaning business owners on r/CleaningBusiness and Facebook groups
3. Build MVP: recurring schedule + room-by-room checklists + photo verification + auto-invoicing
4. Launch on AppSumo + cleaning business Facebook groups simultaneously

## Risks

1. **Fragmented market**: Cleaning businesses range from solo operators to 50-person crews with very different needs
2. **Low price tolerance**: Cleaning businesses have thinner margins than trades, may resist even $69 LTD
3. **ZenMaid brand loyalty**: ZenMaid has strong presence in the maid service niche -- need to differentiate (Airbnb focus or commercial focus)

## Product Concept

**Working name**: "CleanSlate"

**Core MVP features**:
- Visual recurring schedule (drag-and-drop, handles skip weeks/holidays)
- Customizable per-room checklists with photo verification
- One-tap clock-in that auto-generates invoices
- Online booking with real-time availability and drive-time awareness
- Client portal showing cleaning history and before/after photos
- Ultra-simple cleaner mobile app ("Uber-simple" interface for non-tech-savvy staff)

**Key differentiators**:
1. Ultra-simple cleaner app -- designed for non-tech-savvy cleaning staff
2. Recurring schedule engine built for cleaning (skip weeks, holiday rules, biweekly patterns)
3. Photo verification -- cleaners snap before/after photos per room that clients can view
4. Flat pricing, not per-cleaner

**LTD price point**: $69 (up to 5 cleaners) / $129 (unlimited cleaners)

**Target channels**: r/CleaningBusiness (35K+), Facebook groups (Cleaning Business Owners - 50K+, Maid Service Millionaires - 20K+, House Cleaning Pros - 15K+), CleanFax magazine/forums, ISSA trade shows, TikTok/YouTube cleaning business content creators

**Sub-segment opportunity -- Airbnb turnover cleaning**:
- Integrate with Airbnb/VRBO calendars
- Auto-schedule cleaners after checkout
- Quality photo verification for hosts
- Turnaround time tracking
- This sub-segment has almost zero purpose-built tools and clear workflow
