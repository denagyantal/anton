# Testimonial Collection & Display

**Evaluation Score**: 70/95 (Tier 1 — #8)
**Verdict**: BUILD

## One-Line Pitch
Collect testimonials in 1 click, display them beautifully with embeddable widgets. Simpler and cheaper than Senja.

## Problem
Solo entrepreneurs need simple testimonial collection but the process is fragmented — chasing customers via email, formatting quotes, adding to website manually. Senja.io proved the market ($1M ARR) but is getting complex and expensive.

## Evidence of Demand
- Senja.io crossed $1M ARR (~$83K MRR) by Nov 2025 — market validated
- Social proof tools sell well on AppSumo
- Universal need for every SaaS, freelancer, and small business

## Our Product
- **1-click collection**: Simple form or email request for testimonials
- **Import**: Pull from Twitter, G2, Product Hunt automatically
- **Embed widgets**: Beautiful testimonial walls, carousels, popups
- **Social proof notifications**: "X people signed up today" popups
- **Video testimonials**: Record and display video reviews

## Go-To-Market
- **LTD Price**: $59 (unlimited testimonials and widgets)
- **MRR Price**: $19/mo after LTD phase
- **Target channels**: Indie Hackers, #buildinpublic, r/SaaS, AppSumo

## Risks
1. Senja is strong with $1M ARR — need clear differentiation
2. Commoditized category
3. Low expansion revenue

## Next Steps
1. Build collection form + embed widget MVP (2 weeks)
2. Add 1-click import from Twitter/G2 (1 week)
3. Launch as "the simpler Senja" on AppSumo
