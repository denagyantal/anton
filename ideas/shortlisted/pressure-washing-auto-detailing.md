## Concept
Visual-first business tool: photo-based quoting (annotate areas on property photo, assign prices), before/after photo gallery per client, automated review request, recurring scheduling, chemical usage tracking, route optimization. Marketing page builder for showcasing results.

## Next Steps
1. MVP: photo quoting, before/after gallery, scheduling, invoicing
2. Pressure washing first (faster growing, less competitive)
3. Auto-generate before/after social posts as marketing feature

## Risks
1. Small addressable market standalone
2. May be better as FSM sub-vertical
3. Seasonal demand
