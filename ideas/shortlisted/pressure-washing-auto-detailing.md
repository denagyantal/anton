## Key Differentiators
1. Photo-based quoting (annotate areas on property photo → assign prices)
2. Before/after gallery doubles as marketing tool
3. Chemical/supply tracking per job
4. Purpose-built for visual/exterior cleaning (not generic FSM)

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $59 (solo operator, unlimited quotes/jobs)
- **Tier 2**: $79 (+ crew management, route optimization, marketing page builder)

## Next Steps
1. MVP: photo quoting + scheduling + before/after gallery + invoicing + auto review request
2. Launch in r/pressurewashing and r/AutoDetailing
3. AppSumo at $59/$79

## Risks
1. Niche may be too small (mitigate: expand to window/gutter/soft washing)
2. No established buying behavior for purpose-built software
3. Seasonal in many markets
