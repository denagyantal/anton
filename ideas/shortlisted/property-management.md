## Market Data

## Key Differentiators

1. $19-29/mo flat (not per-unit) — filling the dead zone
2. Next-day ACH at flat monthly fee (not per-transaction)
3. AI-first at small landlord pricing (only AppFolio at $298+/mo has AI today)
4. One-click tax prep with Schedule E export
5. State-specific legal compliance built in
6. Transparent pricing with one-click cancellation

## Next Steps

1. Build MVP: rent collection, lease management, maintenance requests, expense tracking
2. Validate on BiggerPockets forums
3. Add AI expense categorization + Schedule E export
4. Launch LTD at $79 targeting 5-50 unit landlords

## Risks

1. Payment processing reliability is table stakes and complex
2. Free competitors (Avail, Innago) create price pressure
3. State-specific legal compliance requires broad research
