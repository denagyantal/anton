## Concept
Purpose-built for pest control: route-optimized scheduling with recurring contracts, chemical application log per property (product, amount, EPA number, target pest), auto-generated regulatory compliance reports, before/after photos, customer portal, automated re-service reminders. Chemical inventory tracker with low-stock alerts. State-specific compliance templates.
