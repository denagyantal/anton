# Property Management for Small Landlords

**Score**: 91/105
**Verdict**: BUILD
**LTD Price**: $99

## One-Line Pitch
One unified tool for the 5-20 unit self-managing landlord: rent collection + Schedule E automation + maintenance + leases for $99 one-time.

## Market
- $5.88B market
- 9.7M landlords, 80% self-manage, 40%+ still on spreadsheets

## Key Differentiators
- Flat-rate unlimited units (not per-unit pricing)
- Schedule E tax automation
- Transparent pricing with zero hidden fees
- Mobile-first with reliable app
- AI maintenance triage

## Target Channels
- BiggerPockets forums
- r/landlord, r/realestateinvesting
- REIA chapters
- AppSumo

## Top 3 Risks
1. Crowded market with free tools (Avail, TurboTenant, Innago)
2. Payment processing reliability and transaction cost margins
3. State-specific legal compliance for leases and notices
