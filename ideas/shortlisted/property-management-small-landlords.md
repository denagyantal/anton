# Property Management for Small Landlords (1-20 Units) — Score: 98/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: BUILD
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
All-in-one landlord tool for self-managing landlords: rent collection (ACH + card via Plaid), digital lease signing, tenant screening, maintenance request portal with photo upload, expense tracking with receipt OCR, and Schedule E-ready tax reporting. Designed for landlords with a day job, not property management companies. Mobile-first, 15-minute onboarding.

## Next Steps
1. MVP: rent collection (Plaid ACH), lease storage, maintenance portal, expense tracking, Schedule E export
2. Position for "landlords with a day job" — manage from phone, 15-minute setup
3. Recruit beta users on BiggerPockets and r/realestateinvesting
4. Time AppSumo for Sept-Oct (tax season prep)

## Risks
1. Free alternatives set expectations — must clearly justify paid
2. Rent collection transaction costs eat LTD margins
3. Stessa's 350K users could create competitive pressure if Roofstock stabilizes
