## Scoring Breakdown

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | AppFolio, Buildium, Stessa (acquired by Roofstock), Avail (acquired by Realtor.com), TurboTenant all validate. 10M+ individual landlords in US. Constant r/landlord and BiggerPockets discussions. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | AppFolio/Buildium too expensive and built for PM companies. Avail/TenantCloud free but "feel abandoned." Stessa is financial tracking only. Gap between "free but broken" and "enterprise expensive" is wide. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $79-149 LTD is very profitable. Core features (rent collection via Stripe/Plaid, lease storage, maintenance tickets) have low per-user infrastructure costs. Landlords are famously cost-conscious -- LTD is perfect. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Avail, TenantCloud, Stessa all have free tiers, creating free-tier expectation. Need to differentiate clearly or offer limited free tier with paid LTD upgrade. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | r/landlord (65K+), r/realestateinvesting (500K+), BiggerPockets (2M+ members). Facebook landlord groups. Local REIA meetups. This audience is online, engaged, and actively discussing software. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | Massive SEO: "landlord software", "rent collection app", "property management software for small landlords", "Buildium alternative", "landlord accounting software". Comparison and educational content opportunities are enormous. |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Real estate investors are deal-savvy, tool-hungry, and many are on AppSumo. BiggerPockets community cross-pollinates with AppSumo audience. This would be a top AppSumo performer. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Landlords are vocal about tools they use (see BiggerPockets reviews, G2 reviews for Buildium/AppFolio). If the tool saves them hassle, they will review. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | LTD for base (up to 10 units), MRR for scaling (11+ units, tenant screening at $25/screen, payment processing fees, premium features like AI maintenance triage). Per-unit pricing above LTD threshold. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | MVP (rent collection + lease storage + maintenance tickets + basic accounting) in 4-5 weeks. Stripe/Plaid for payments, file storage for leases, simple ticketing. Well-understood domain. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Property management is unglamorous professional services. Not as boring as plumbing, but solidly unsexy. |
| **TOTAL** | | | **85/105** | |

## Next Steps

1. Validate with 10 small landlords (cold outreach on r/landlord, BiggerPockets)
2. Build MVP focused on: rent collection (ACH) + digital lease signing + maintenance request portal + expense tracking
3. Partner with BiggerPockets for content/distribution
4. Plan AppSumo launch -- this category will perform well

## Risks

1. **Free-tier pressure**: Avail, TenantCloud, TurboTenant free tiers create price sensitivity -- need clear value-add over free options
2. **Payment compliance**: Rent collection requires ACH regulations compliance, handling tenant disputes
3. **Newer entrants**: DoorLoop and RentRedi are targeting similar space -- must differentiate on UX and pricing

## Product Concept

**Working name**: "LandlordPad"

**Core MVP features**:
- Online rent collection (ACH + card via Stripe/Plaid)
- Digital lease signing and storage
- Tenant screening integration
- Maintenance request portal with photo upload
- Expense tracking per property
- Year-end Schedule E tax report generation

**Key differentiators**:

2. Built for landlords, not property management companies
3. Tax-ready -- generates Schedule E data and exports to TurboTax/CPA
4. Maintenance requests with AI-powered severity assessment and vendor suggestions

**LTD price point**: $79 (up to 10 units) / $149 (up to 50 units, unlimited)

**Target channels**: r/landlord (65K+ members), r/realestateinvesting (500K+ members), BiggerPockets forums (2M+ members), Facebook groups (Landlord & Tenant Rights groups, Real Estate Investor groups), local REIA meetups, BiggerPockets podcast sponsorship
