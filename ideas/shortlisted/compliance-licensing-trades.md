# Compliance & Licensing Management for Trades — Score: 84/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: BUILD (add-on or standalone quick-win)
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Dashboard tracking license expiration dates with auto-reminders, CE credit requirements/completion, insurance certificates (COI tracking), EPA certifications, vehicle inspection schedules, OSHA training records. Auto-pulls renewal deadlines from state databases. Alerts 90/60/30 days before expiration.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | Almost no purpose-built tools. Greenfield. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | No competition. Filing cabinets are the "competitor." |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $79-99 LTD. High perceived value (avoiding fines). |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Compliance tools are paid. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Trade associations, supply houses, FB groups. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | Low-competition SEO: "HVAC license renewal tracking." |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Niche but "avoid $10K fines" is compelling. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Preventing license loss = loyal customers. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | State database updates, auto-filing as premium. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Tracker + reminders in 2-3 weeks. State data incremental. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Compliance — deeply boring. |

## Next Steps
1. MVP: license/cert tracker with 90/60/30-day reminders, CE tracking, insurance COI
2. Start with ONE state (TX, FL, or CA)
3. Could bundle within FSM or sell standalone
4. Trade association partnerships for distribution

## Risks
1. Greenfield = unproven demand
2. State databases are labor-intensive to build
3. Regulatory data changes frequently
