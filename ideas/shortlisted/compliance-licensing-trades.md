# Compliance & Licensing Management for Trades

**Score: 83/105** | **Verdict: BUILD (Greenfield)** | **Priority: #13**

## Concept
Simple dashboard tracking: license expiration dates (with auto-reminders), CE credit requirements and completion, insurance certificates (COI tracking), EPA certifications, vehicle inspection schedules, OSHA training records. Auto-pulls renewal deadlines from state databases. 90/60/30-day alerts before anything expires.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | Greenfield — almost no purpose-built tools exist. Compliance burden increasing (EPA, OSHA, state licensing). |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | No SMB competition. Enterprise tools (ComplianceQuest) are for manufacturing. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $79-99 LTD. "Avoid a $10K fine" is compelling ROI. |
| No Free Tier | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | No free compliance trackers for trades. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Trade associations, supply houses, FB groups. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "HVAC license renewal tracking", "contractor compliance 2026". Greenfield SEO. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Niche but "avoid fines" is compelling. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | High-value = grateful reviews. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | LTD tracker → MRR for auto-filing, database updates, multi-state. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | 2-3 week core MVP. State database is incremental effort. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Peak boring — compliance tracking. |

## Key Differentiators
1. Greenfield — no purpose-built competition
2. State-specific database of licensing requirements
3. Automated alerts prevent costly lapses
4. Could expand to auto-filing renewals

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $79 (up to 5 employees, single state)
- **Tier 2**: $99 (unlimited employees, multi-state, insurance COI tracking)

## Next Steps
1. MVP: license/cert tracker with 90/60/30-day reminders + CE tracking + COI tracking
2. Start with top 5 states (TX, FL, CA, NY, OH)
3. Partner with trade associations for distribution
4. Content: "2026 [state] contractor license requirements" pages (SEO play)

## Risks
1. Building state-specific database is labor-intensive
2. Low urgency until something expires
3. Might be a feature of FSM rather than standalone
