# Roofing & Exterior Contractor Estimating — Score: 80/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Photo-centric estimating for exterior contractors: photos from ground/drone, annotate damage areas, auto-calculate measurements from satellite imagery, generate branded proposals with photo evidence, material calculators (squares of shingles, linear feet of gutters), insurance supplement tools. Before/during/after photo timeline per job.

## Scoring Summary
Market Validation: 4/5 (3x=12) | Competitor Weakness: 4/5 (2x=8) | LTD Viability: 4/5 (2x=8) | No Free Tier: 4/5 (1x=4) | Channel Access: 3/5 (2x=6) | Content: 4/5 (1x=4) | AppSumo: 3/5 (2x=6) | Reviews: 4/5 (1x=4) | MRR Path: 4/5 (3x=12) | Build: 3/5 (2x=6) | Boring Bonus: 5/5 (2x=10)

## Next Steps
1. Validate: can satellite measurement be integrated affordably?
2. MVP without satellite: photo proposals + material calculators + manual measurements
3. Storm season launch (March-April)

## Risks
- EagleView has strong measurement data moat
- Satellite imagery APIs expensive
- Storm chaser segment is transient
