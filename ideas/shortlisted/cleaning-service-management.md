# Cleaning Service Management — Score: 100/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: BUILD
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
All-in-one platform for residential and commercial cleaning businesses: recurring schedule engine with skip-week/holiday handling, per-room checklists with photo verification, cleaner clock-in that auto-generates invoices, online booking with real-time availability, client portal, two-way SMS, route optimization, and payroll sync. Ultra-simple cleaner-facing mobile app.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | ZenMaid, BookingKoala, Swept, MaidCentral all have paying customers. $90B cleaning industry. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | ZenMaid no 2-way SMS. BookingKoala COO hostile to users. MaidCentral $450/mo. Jobber $300-400/mo real cost. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $69-129 LTD profitable. Low infra costs. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Most cleaning tools are paid. Maidily at $25/mo sets low floor. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | r/CleaningBusiness (35K+), r/EntrepreneurRideAlong, FB groups (50K+ members). |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | High-volume keywords: "cleaning business software", "ZenMaid alternative." |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Cleaning owners are price-sensitive deal seekers. Perfect AppSumo demographic. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Active online community will share tools that save time. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Per-cleaner pricing, route optimization, Airbnb integration as premium. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Scheduling + checklists + invoicing in 3-5 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Deeply boring — cleaning, janitorial. |

## Next Steps
1. Pick sub-niche for v1: residential maid service OR Airbnb turnover cleaning
2. Build MVP: recurring schedule + per-room checklists + clock-in/auto-invoice + client portal
3. Recruit 5 beta users from r/CleaningBusiness or FB groups
4. AppSumo launch at $69-129 LTD + FB group marketing blitz

## Risks
1. Fragmented market with many small competitors — must differentiate sharply (photo verification, ultra-simple cleaner app)
2. Cleaning staff tech literacy — cleaner app must be dead simple
3. Airbnb turnover requires calendar API integrations
