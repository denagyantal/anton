## Target Market
Residential cleaning companies with 1-15 cleaners, maid services, house cleaning solopreneurs. Also: Airbnb turnover cleaning companies (sub-niche entry point).

## Key Differentiators
1. Ultra-simple cleaner app — "Uber-simple" for non-tech-savvy staff
2. Recurring schedule engine built for cleaning (skip weeks, holiday rules, biweekly patterns)
3. Photo verification — cleaners snap before/after photos per room
4. Flat pricing — no per-cleaner fees. "Doesn't punish you for growing"
5. Built-in two-way SMS (ZenMaid can't do this)

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $69 (up to 5 cleaners)
- **Tier 2**: $149 (unlimited cleaners, payroll sync, route optimization)

## Next Steps
1. Build MVP: visual recurring schedule + per-room checklists + photo verification + one-tap invoicing + ultra-simple cleaner app
2. Consider Airbnb turnover cleaning as focused entry point (integrate with Airbnb/VRBO calendars)
3. Launch on AppSumo + seed in r/CleaningBusiness and FB groups simultaneously

## Risks
1. ZenMaid has established community (ZenMaid Magazine)
2. Cleaners are non-technical — onboarding must be extremely simple
3. Payroll integration (Gusto/QBO sync) adds complexity
