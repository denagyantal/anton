# Construction Management for Small Contractors

**Score: 85/105** | **Verdict: EXPLORE FURTHER** | **Priority: #10**

## Concept
Simplified project management for 1-10 person construction companies. Estimating, daily logs, photo documentation, scheduling, invoicing. Not a scaled-down Procore — purpose-built for the small contractor who currently uses OneNote, Google Docs, and spreadsheets.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | Procore, Buildertrend, CoConstruct all have paying users. $16.62B market by 2030. 3.7M construction businesses. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Procore $375+/mo. Top answer: "ONE NOTE can be configured into a MONSTER" — hacking non-purpose-built tools. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $99-149 LTD. Contractors prefer to "own" tools. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Limited free options. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | r/Construction, r/Contractor, r/ConstructionManagers, FB groups, trade shows. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "construction management software small business", "Procore alternative". |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Contractors less on AppSumo but would buy LTDs via industry channels. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Contractors review tools on Capterra and forums. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | LTD core → MRR for permit tracking, subcontractor management, reporting. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Construction PM is complex. 6-8 week MVP even for simplified version. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Deeply boring — construction management. |

## Target Market
Small GCs, subcontractors, specialty trades (concrete, framing, painting), remodelers with 1-10 employees.

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $99 (estimating, daily logs, photo docs, invoicing)
- **Tier 2**: $149 (+ permit tracking, scheduling, subcontractor management)

## Next Steps
1. Focus MVP on "quote to invoice" workflow: estimating + daily logs + photos + invoicing
2. Skip full project management for v1
3. Test demand with landing page in r/Contractor
4. Consider partnership with Buildbite or Planera

## Risks
1. Full construction PM is very complex (mitigate: narrow scope)
2. Procore/Buildertrend could launch lite tiers
3. Each sub-trade has different workflows
