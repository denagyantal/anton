# Construction Management for Small Contractors — Score: 83/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Simplified project management for 1-10 person construction companies. Estimating, scheduling, photo documentation, client communication, and invoicing. Not a scaled-down Procore — purpose-built for the contractor whose current "system" is OneNote + Google Docs + spreadsheets.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | Procore ($375+/mo), Buildertrend ($199+/mo). $16.62B market by 2030. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | All enterprise-priced. OneNote is top "tool" for small contractors. |
| LTD Viability | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | $99-149 LTD thin for complex product. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | PM tools are paid. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | r/ConstructionManagers (40+ comments), r/Contractor. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "construction management small business." |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Contractors less on AppSumo. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Will review if it replaces their chaos. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Project pricing, sub management, permits. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Estimating + scheduling + photos + invoicing — complex. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Small construction — deeply boring. |

## Next Steps
1. Validate: can we build competitive MVP in 4-6 weeks?
2. Focus: estimate → schedule → document → invoice pipeline
3. Talk to 5 small contractors

## Risks
1. Complex product vs. well-funded incumbents
2. Construction projects vary enormously
3. Many contractors are technophobic
