# Privacy-First Email Marketing

**Evaluation Score**: 74/95 (Tier 1 — #5)
**Verdict**: BUILD

## One-Line Pitch
GDPR-native email marketing — EU-hosted, pay per email sent (not per subscriber), no tracking unless you opt in. The anti-Mailchimp.

## Problem
Mailchimp doubled prices and removed free tier features. GDPR compliance is a "nightmare" with most tools. Subscriber-based pricing punishes you for having inactive subscribers. EU businesses need a tool that's privacy-first by default, not as an afterthought.

## Evidence of Demand
- Email marketing is $10B+ market
- GDPR enforcement: 2,679 fines totaling €6.7B as of Dec 2025
- "Mailchimp keeps raising prices" — top complaint across r/Entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness
- 7% of all Reddit software requests demand privacy-first alternatives (640+ posts)
- Email marketing tools are consistently top AppSumo sellers

## Our Product
- **EU-hosted**: All data stays in EU by default
- **Pay per send**: Charge by emails sent, not subscribers. Don't pay for inactive lists.
- **GDPR baked in**: Consent management, data residency, transparent practices, DPA included
- **No tracking by default**: Tracking pixels opt-in, not opt-out
- **Clean automation**: Visual flow builder for welcome sequences, drip campaigns
- **Template builder**: Modern, responsive email templates

## Go-To-Market
- **LTD Price**: $69 (10K emails/mo included)
- **MRR Price**: $19/mo (5K emails) / $39/mo (25K emails)
- **Target channels**: r/privacy, r/Entrepreneur, EU business forums, GDPR communities, AppSumo
- **AppSumo potential**: YES — email tools are perennial top sellers, privacy angle is fresh differentiator

## Risks
1. Email deliverability is extremely hard to get right
2. Infrastructure costs are real (per-email sending costs)
3. Competing with well-funded players (Mailchimp, ConvertKit)
4. LTD users sending high volumes could be costly

## Next Steps
1. Partner with Resend or Postmark for email API (week 1)
2. Build email editor + automation builder (3-4 weeks)
3. Set up EU hosting infrastructure
4. Beta test with 20 EU-based small businesses
5. Launch with "Mailchimp alternative that respects your privacy" positioning
