# Contractor Quoting & Estimating Tool

**Score: 90/105** | **Verdict: BUILD (Quick Win)** | **Priority: #3**

## Concept
Mobile-first quoting app where contractors select from trade-specific templates (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, painting), customize line items, add photos, and send a professional branded PDF via text/email in under 2 minutes. Includes e-signatures, payment deposit links, and automatic follow-up reminders. Accepted quotes auto-convert to invoices.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Joist acquired by Buildertrend. Invoice Simple validated. 3.7M construction businesses in US. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Estimating software $275-950/user/mo. Built for large GCs, not solo trades. Security issues (wrong client emails). |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $59-79 LTD, very low marginal cost. Trades workers want to pay once and own it. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | No free trade-specific quoting with templates. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | r/sweatystartup 200K+, r/HVAC, r/Plumbing, r/electricians, r/Contractor. Same massive channels. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "plumbing estimate app", "HVAC quoting software", "contractor estimate template". High intent. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Affordable, clear value prop, quick setup. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Speed-to-quote = faster close rate = measurable ROI. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | LTD → MRR for trade-specific pricing databases, AI estimation from photos, e-signatures. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | 2-3 week MVP. Fastest to build on this list. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Deeply boring — contractor quoting. Pen-and-paper replacement. |

## Target Market
Solo plumbers, electricians, HVAC techs, handymen, painters, small contractors. The tradesperson who currently writes estimates on paper or a napkin.

## Key Differentiators
1. Trade-specific templates (plumbing jobs, electrical jobs, HVAC jobs — not generic)
2. Under 2 minutes from start to sent
3. Photo documentation attached to quotes
4. Recipient validation to prevent "wrong client" security issues
5. Auto-convert accepted quote to invoice

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $59 (unlimited quotes, basic templates)
- **Tier 2**: $79 (+ trade-specific pricing databases, e-signatures, payment links)

## Distribution Channels
- r/sweatystartup, r/HVAC, r/Plumbing, r/electricians, r/Contractor
- Supply houses (Ferguson, Home Depot Pro)
- Trade schools
- Facebook groups for contractors
- AppSumo launch

## Next Steps
1. Build MVP: trade templates → customize line items → add photos → branded PDF → text/email → e-signature → auto-convert to invoice
2. Start with plumbing templates (strongest signal), expand to HVAC, electrical
3. Launch on AppSumo at $59/$79 within 4 weeks
4. Position as gateway product to full FSM platform

## Risks
1. Could become commoditized as FSM tools improve quoting
2. Limited standalone MRR potential (better as gateway to FSM)
3. Competing with free Jobber/HCP quoting modules
