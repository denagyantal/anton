# Contractor Quoting & Estimating Tool — Score: 91/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: BUILD (quick-win or feature of larger FSM)
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Mobile-first quoting app: select trade-specific templates, customize line items, add photos, send branded PDF via text/email in under 2 minutes. E-signatures, payment deposit links, automatic follow-up reminders, quote-to-invoice conversion. Recipient validation prevents wrong-client errors.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Joist (acquired), Invoice Simple, Jobber quoting. Multiple HN attempts prove demand. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Generic, not trade-specific. Construction estimating $275-950/user/mo. Privacy breaches reported. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $59-79 LTD. Very low cost. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Free invoice tools exist. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | r/sweatystartup (200K+), all trade subreddits, supply houses. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "plumbing estimate app", "contractor estimate template." |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Perfect AppSumo product. Simple, clear, affordable. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Faster quotes = more closed jobs = happy users. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | Standalone may be hard to upsell. Better as entry to larger product. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Templates + PDF gen + e-sig + mobile in 2-3 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Trades quoting — deeply boring. |

## Next Steps
1. Build as standalone OR core feature of FSM product
2. Pre-built templates for plumbing, HVAC, electrical, painting
3. Launch at $59-79 LTD on AppSumo
4. Key: photo attachment, e-signature, payment deposit, auto-follow-up

## Risks
1. May be too simple for standalone — better as feature
2. Trade-specific pricing databases need maintenance
3. Quoting is bundled in every FSM
