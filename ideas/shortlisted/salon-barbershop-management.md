**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: BUILD
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Booking and business management for independent stylists and small salons. Beautiful booking page (no marketplace — YOUR clients, YOUR brand). Client profiles with formula/preference history. Built-in POS for retail. Tip management and daily cash-out reporting. No per-provider pricing. Instagram/social-first booking.
