# Salon & Barbershop Management (ChairTime)

**Score: 84/105** | **Verdict: BUILD (Quick Win)** | **Priority: #11**

## Concept
Beautiful booking page (no marketplace — YOUR clients, YOUR brand). Client profiles with formula/preference history. Built-in POS for retail products. Tip management and daily cash-out reporting. Instagram/social-first booking. No per-provider pricing.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | Vagaro, Fresha, Booksy, GlossGenius, Boulevard all have paying users. 1M+ salons/barbershops. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Fresha "free" but 20% commission. Vagaro per-stylist pricing. Marketplaces send clients to competitors. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $59-119 LTD viable. Low marginal cost. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Square Appointments free for solo. Fresha "free" with commissions. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Behind The Chair 200K+, r/hairstylist, r/Barber, Instagram beauty community. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "salon booking software", "Fresha alternative". |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Stylists more on Instagram/TikTok. Social-first launch needed. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Stylists are vocal and social. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | LTD for booking/CRM → MRR for POS, inventory, marketing. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | 3-5 week MVP. Simplest workflow on this list. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Small business but not deeply boring. Beauty has some glamour. |

## Key Differentiators
1. No marketplace — platform never competes with you for your clients
2. Formula & preference tracking — built for stylists, not generic appointments
3. Flat pricing for whole salon — not per-chair/per-stylist
4. Instagram/social-first booking — direct booking from social profiles

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $59 (solo stylist, unlimited clients)
- **Tier 2**: $119 (up to 5 stylists, retail POS included)

## Next Steps
1. Build MVP: beautiful booking page + client profiles with formula history + appointment management + tips
2. Instagram/TikTok-first launch — booking page must be "Instagram-worthy"
3. Partner with cosmetology schools

## Risks
1. Fresha's "free" model hard to compete against on price
2. Square Appointments free tier for solo stylists
3. Beauty market crowded with solutions
