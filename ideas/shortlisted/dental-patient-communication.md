# Dental Practice Patient Communication

**Score: 85/105** | **Verdict: BUILD** | **Priority: #9**

## Concept
Standalone patient communication platform that works with any dental PMS. Automated appointment reminders (text/email), post-visit review requests, treatment plan follow-ups, recall campaigns for overdue patients, two-way texting, and online scheduling widget. Don't replace Dentrix — sit on top of it.

## Target Market
Independent dental practices (1-3 dentist offices). The practice paying $300+/mo for Weave or using no communication platform at all.

## Key Differentiators
1. Open API approach — works with any PMS (not locked to one ecosystem)
2. "Weave features at 1/5 the price"
3. Automated recall campaigns for overdue patients (revenue generator)
4. Digital intake forms with smart conditional logic

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $79 (single practice, 500 texts/mo included)
- **Tier 2**: $99 (+ digital intake forms, review management, unlimited texts at $0.02/text overage)

## Next Steps
1. MVP: text appointment reminders + digital intake forms + post-visit review requests + 2-way texting + recall campaigns
2. Market through dental practice management FB groups, ADA channels
3. Position as "Weave features at 1/5 the price"

## Risks
1. Weave has massive installed base and brand recognition
2. EHR/PMS integration is complex and needed for full value
3. Healthcare compliance (HIPAA) adds development complexity
