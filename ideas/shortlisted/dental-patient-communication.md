# Dental Practice Patient Communication — Score: 77/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: EXPLORE (patient communication add-on only; PASS on full PMS)
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Standalone patient communication platform for dental practices: automated text/email reminders, post-visit review requests, treatment plan follow-ups, recall campaigns for overdue patients, two-way texting, online scheduling widget. Works alongside any existing PMS (Dentrix, Eaglesoft, Open Dental). "Weave for dental at 1/3 the price."

**Full PMS is NOT recommended** — Archy has $47M funding and 300% growth. Focus on communication layer only.

## Scoring Summary
Market Validation: 5/5 (3x=15) | Competitor Weakness: 5/5 (2x=10) | LTD Viability: 2/5 (2x=4) | No Free Tier: 5/5 (1x=5) | Channel Access: 3/5 (2x=6) | Content: 4/5 (1x=4) | AppSumo: 2/5 (2x=4) | Reviews: 4/5 (1x=4) | MRR Path: 5/5 (3x=15) | Build: 1/5 (2x=2) | Boring Bonus: 4/5 (2x=8)

## Next Steps
1. Build communication-only tool (NOT full PMS)
2. MVP: text reminders, recall campaigns, review requests, 2-way texting
3. Target practices using Dentrix/Eaglesoft who can't afford Weave ($300+/mo)

## Risks
- Full PMS is multi-year project competing with $47M Archy
- HIPAA compliance required
- Weave has strong brand in dental
