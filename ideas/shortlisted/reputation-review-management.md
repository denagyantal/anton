# Reputation & Review Management for Local Businesses — Score: 89/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: BUILD (quick-win / add-on product)
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Dead-simple review collection: after each job, auto-text customer with Google review link, track responses, display reviews via website widget, alert on negative reviews. AI-powered review response drafting. Auto-create social media posts from best reviews. Under $30/mo or LTD.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | Birdeye ($300+/mo), Podium ($250+/mo), Weave ($1B+ company). |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Birdeye and Podium expensive. No simple tool under $30/mo. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $49-69 LTD. SMS costs need limits. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Manual requests are free. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Every local business community. Universal need. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "get more Google reviews" — massive volume. |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Every SMB wants reviews. Perfect AppSumo product. |
| Review Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | A review tool generates its own reviews. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | Simple tool limits upsell. SMS costs drive recurring. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | MVP in 2 weeks: Twilio + Google API + dashboard. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Crosses industries. Somewhat tech-adjacent. |

## Next Steps
1. MVP in 2 weeks: auto-text review request → Google link → dashboard → negative alert
2. AI review response drafting in v2
3. Launch at $49-69 LTD — ship FIRST while building larger products
4. Bundle with any vertical SaaS later

## Risks
1. Very simple — low defensibility, easy to clone
2. SMS costs eat LTD margins — need message limits
3. Google API changes could break core functionality
