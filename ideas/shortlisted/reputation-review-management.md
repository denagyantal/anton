# Reputation & Review Management for Local Businesses

**Score: 89/105** | **Verdict: BUILD (Quick Win)** | **Priority: #4**

## Concept
Dead-simple review collection for local service businesses under $30/mo (or LTD). After each job: auto-text customer with Google review link, track response, display reviews on website widget, basic reputation monitoring with negative review alerts. AI-powered review response drafting.

## Scoring

| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Incumbents overpriced for SMBs. Feature bloat — most need only review collection. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $49-69 LTD. Very low marginal cost. High perceived value. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Some free review tools exist. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | All local business channels — trade subreddits, FB groups, BNI groups. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "get more Google reviews", "review management software small business". High volume. |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Review tools perform very well on AppSumo historically. |
| Review Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | Meta: a review tool naturally generates reviews from happy users! |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | LTD → MRR for AI responses, multi-location, social posting, analytics. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | 2 week MVP. Twilio SMS + Google Places API + dashboard. Fastest build. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Serves boring businesses but review management is common SaaS. |

## Target Market
All local service businesses: plumbers, HVAC, dentists, auto repair, salons, cleaning, landscaping, roofing, moving companies. Universal need.

## Key Differentiators
1. Trades-focused (not generic marketing suite)
2. Dead simple — just reviews, no bloat
3. AI review response drafting (respond to all reviews in one click)
4. $49-69 LTD vs $250-300/mo incumbents

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $49 (single location, unlimited review requests)
- **Tier 2**: $69 (+ AI response drafting, website widget, social posting)

## Next Steps
1. Build MVP: auto-text after service → Google review link → track → dashboard → negative alerts
2. Launch on AppSumo at $49/$69 within 3-4 weeks
3. Partner with BNI groups and local business networks
4. Cross-sell to FSM and quoting tool users

## Risks
1. Commoditized market — many competitors
2. Google API changes could break functionality
3. Low MRR ceiling as standalone (best as part of broader platform)
