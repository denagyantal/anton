## Scoring Breakdown

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Birdeye ($300+/mo), Podium ($250+/mo), NiceJob ($75/mo) all prove market. Google reviews are #1 driver of new customers for local businesses. Algorithm updates in 2025-2026 favor review velocity. |
| Competitor Weakness | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | NiceJob at $75/mo and GatherUp are closer to affordable. But Birdeye/Podium are overbuilt CRM/messaging suites. The gap is a dead-simple, reviews-only tool under $30/mo. Competition is moderate. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $49-69 LTD is very profitable. Minimal infrastructure (Twilio SMS + Google Places API). Per-user costs extremely low. High perceived value. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Some basic review tools exist for free (manual Google review link sharing). NiceJob and others have free trials. Need to show clear automation value over DIY. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Crosses all local business verticals -- every trade subreddit, every local business Facebook group, BNI/networking groups, Chamber of Commerce. Wide reach but less focused than vertical tools. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | Exceptional SEO: "get more Google reviews", "review management software small business", "Birdeye alternative". Evergreen content about local SEO and reviews. |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Review/reputation tools perform extremely well on AppSumo. Digital marketers and small business owners on AppSumo understand review value. This would be a natural AppSumo hit. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Ironic: a review management tool needs reviews to succeed. Users will review if it demonstrably grows their review count. But the tool itself is less "daily-use" than FSM or PM software. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | LTD for base (review requests + monitoring). MRR for: SMS volume overages, AI review response drafting, multi-location management, review-to-social content, advanced analytics. Path exists but retention risk -- users may feel "done" after initial review boost. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Fastest to build of all ideas. MVP in 2 weeks. Twilio for SMS + Google Places API + simple dashboard. Very low complexity. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Cross-vertical (not industry-specific). Review management is general small business ops, not a specific boring trade. |
| **TOTAL** | | | **76/105** | |

## Next Steps

1. Consider building as a standalone quick-win product OR as a module within the FSM/PM platform
2. MVP in 2 weeks -- validate demand with $49 LTD pre-sale
3. Launch on AppSumo first -- this category has proven AppSumo fit
4. Use revenue to fund development of larger FSM or PM product

## Risks

1. **Low stickiness**: Users could churn after initial review boost -- review collection feels "done" after a few months
2. **Moderate competition**: NiceJob at $75/mo is already reasonably affordable -- the gap is not as dramatic as FSM
3. **API dependency**: Google API changes could break core functionality (review monitoring)

## Product Concept

**Working name**: "ReviewPulse"

**Core MVP features**:
- Automated post-service text/email with Google review link
- Review monitoring dashboard (new reviews, rating trends)
- Website review widget (display best reviews)
- Basic reputation alerts (negative review notification)

**Phase 2 features (MRR upsell)**:
- AI-powered review response drafting
- Multi-location management
- Review-to-social content (auto-create posts from best reviews)
- SMS volume-based pricing tiers
- Competitor review benchmarking

**Key differentiators**:
1. Dead-simple -- reviews only, not a CRM/messaging suite
2. Price -- $49 LTD vs. $250-300/mo competitors
3. One-click setup -- connect Google Business Profile, import customer list, start sending

**LTD price point**: $49 (single location, 200 review requests/mo) / $99 (up to 5 locations, unlimited requests)

**Target channels**: Every local business community -- r/smallbusiness, trade subreddits, local business Facebook groups, BNI/networking groups, Chamber of Commerce events, digital marketing agency partnerships

**Strategic note**: This is the fastest path to revenue. 2-week build, AppSumo launch, use the cash flow and customer base to fund FSM and PM development. Can also be integrated as a module within FSM later.
