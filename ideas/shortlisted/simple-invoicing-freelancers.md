# Simple Invoicing for Freelancers

**Evaluation Score**: 73/95 (Tier 1 — #6)
**Verdict**: BUILD

## One-Line Pitch
Send beautiful invoices in 30 seconds with automatic late payment reminders and year-end tax summary. No accounting degree required.

## Problem
"I just need to send invoices, not run an accounting department." FreshBooks keeps raising prices. QuickBooks is overkill for 5 clients. Wave is free but unreliable. Freelancers paying $30/mo to send 10 invoices feels wrong.

## Evidence of Demand
- FreshBooks ($17-$55/mo), QuickBooks ($30-$200/mo) — massive proven market
- Invoicing tools are perennial AppSumo bestsellers
- 70M+ freelancers globally need invoicing
- Recurring price hike complaints across r/freelance, r/smallbusiness

- **Auto-reminders**: Automatic late payment nudges
- **Payment integration**: Stripe + PayPal built in
- **Expense tracking**: Snap receipt photos, categorize expenses
- **Tax summary**: Year-end report for tax filing

## Go-To-Market
- **LTD Price**: $59 (unlimited invoices and clients)
- **MRR Price**: $12/mo after LTD phase
- **Target channels**: r/freelance, r/webdev, Upwork/Fiverr communities, AppSumo

## Risks
1. Wave exists as free alternative
2. Commodity market — need strong UX differentiation
3. Limited expansion revenue from single freelancers

## Next Steps
1. Build invoice template engine + Stripe integration (2 weeks)
2. Add auto-reminders and expense tracking (2 weeks)
3. Beta with 15 freelancers from r/freelance
4. AppSumo launch focused on speed and simplicity
