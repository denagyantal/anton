# Veterinary Practice Management — Score: 77/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER (high reward but high complexity)
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Cloud-native vet PMS for small clinics (1-3 vets): patient records, scheduling, client communication (two-way SMS), multi-vendor lab integration, inventory with expiration tracking, invoicing/payments, prescription management. Lab-vendor-agnostic (not locked to IDEXX). Works on any device, no server. $99-159/mo flat.

**Alternative**: "Weave for vet clinics" — communication layer only (text reminders, vaccination alerts, online booking) at $79-99 LTD. Much faster to build.

## Scoring Summary
Market Validation: 5/5 (3x=15) | Competitor Weakness: 5/5 (2x=10) | LTD Viability: 2/5 (2x=4) | No Free Tier: 5/5 (1x=5) | Channel Access: 3/5 (2x=6) | Content: 4/5 (1x=4) | AppSumo: 1/5 (2x=2) | Reviews: 4/5 (1x=4) | MRR Path: 5/5 (3x=15) | Build: 2/5 (2x=4) | Boring Bonus: 4/5 (2x=8)

## Next Steps
1. Communication-layer approach is faster: text reminders, vaccination alerts, booking
2. Full PIMS is 6-12 month build — not aligned with 4-6 week timeline
3. Validate communication tool with 5 vet clinics

## Risks
- Medical record compliance is complex
- IDEXX lab integration dependency
- Highest build complexity of any idea
