# Veterinary Practice Management (PawChart)

**Score: 77/105** | **Verdict: EXPLORE FURTHER** | **Priority: #23**

## Concept
Modern vet practice management for solo and small practices. Cloud-based, works on any device. Pet owner portal with online booking, digital intake forms, vaccination reminders. Simple medical records (SOAP notes). Inventory with expiration tracking. Lab-agnostic — no IDEXX vendor lock-in.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | IDEXX, eVetPractice, Digitail all paying customers. 32K+ practices. $600M+ market. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | IDEXX lock-in, $300-600/mo, dated UIs. Covetrus "click-heavy." |
| LTD Viability | 2/5 | 2x | 4 | Complex product. Compliance needs. Better as MRR ($99-199/mo). |
| No Free Tier | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | No free vet software. |
| Channel Access | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | VIN, r/veterinary 100K+, AVMA. Niche professional. |
| Content Potential | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | "IDEXX alternative", "veterinary software". Moderate volume. |
| AppSumo Fit | 2/5 | 2x | 4 | Vets not on AppSumo. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Small market but reviews on VIN. |
| MRR Path | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | Clear recurring. Compliance updates, lab integrations, ongoing support. |
| Build Feasibility | 2/5 | 2x | 4 | 8-12 weeks. Medical records compliance, lab integrations, inventory. Highest complexity. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Unglamorous professional service. |

## Key Insight
Strong market with clear competitor weakness, but highest build complexity and poorest LTD fit on the list. Better suited for a team with healthcare/compliance experience. Consider as a longer-term play after validating simpler products.

## Risks
1. IDEXX lab monopoly creates vendor lock-in that's hard to break
2. Medical records compliance is complex and non-negotiable
3. 8-12 week build is longest on the list
4. LTD model doesn't work well — this is naturally MRR
