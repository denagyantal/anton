# Veterinary Practice Communication & Recall — Score: 79/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-24
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER

## One-Line Pitch

Lightweight communication add-on for any vet PMS: vaccine recall, appointment reminders, and review requests for $79-99 one-time.

## LTD Price

$79-99

## Market

- 32K+ vet practices in the US
- Pet care industry valued at $150B+
- Average appointment value $200-500
- 10-15% no-show rate

## Key Differentiators

- Communication layer only (not a PMS replacement)
- 2-way SMS messaging
- Vaccine recall campaigns
- Prescription refill alerts
- Pet-specific templates ("Buddy is due for his rabies booster!")
- Works with any existing PMS

## Target Channels

- r/veterinary (100K+ members)
- r/VetTech
- Vet industry conferences

## Top 3 Risks

1. PMS vendors could build native communication features into their platforms
2. Weave is well-funded and expanding into veterinary
3. Small addressable market (32K practices limits upside)

## Verdict

EXPLORE FURTHER -- The communication-layer approach is fast to build and avoids the complexity of a full PMS. Validate with 5 vet clinics before committing.
