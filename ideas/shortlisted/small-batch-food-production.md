# Small-Batch Manufacturer Production Management — Score: 87/105

**Verdict**: BUILD
**LTD Price**: $79-99
**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-24

## One-Line Pitch

The ERP your micro-bakery can actually afford: production management for small manufacturers at $79-99 one-time.

## Market

- Craftplan Show HN received 577 upvotes — extraordinary validation signal for this niche
- Enterprise ERPs cost $10K-50K/yr, completely out of reach for small producers
- Craftybase (closest competitor) limited in features at $50/mo
- 700K+ cottage food and small-batch manufacturing businesses in the US

## Key Differentiators

- Hosted/managed SaaS (no self-hosting required, unlike open-source Craftplan)
- Vertical-specific templates for bakery, soap, brewery, candle, and cosmetics makers
- Recipe and BOM (bill of materials) with full cost rollups
- E-commerce integrations (Shopify, Etsy, WooCommerce)
- Allergen and ingredient tracking for food safety compliance

## Target Channels

- Hacker News (proven — 577 upvotes on Craftplan post)
- Etsy seller communities and forums
- Bakery, brewery, and soap-making forums
- AppSumo (strong fit for LTD model)

## Top 3 Risks

1. **Open-source Craftplan as free alternative** — technically savvy makers may self-host rather than pay; need to differentiate on ease-of-use, hosting, and integrations
2. **Niche TAM may cap smaller** — while cottage food is growing, the total addressable market for production management tools is inherently bounded
3. **Vertical-specific workflows add complexity** — bakery batching is different from soap curing is different from brewery fermentation; supporting multiple verticals increases build and maintenance cost

## Verdict

BUILD. The Craftplan HN signal (577 upvotes) proves demand exists. Enterprise ERPs are wildly overpriced for this segment, and Craftybase is the only real competitor at an accessible price point. A managed SaaS at $79-99 LTD with vertical templates and e-commerce integrations fills a clear gap. The open-source alternative actually validates the market rather than killing it — most small makers want hosted, not self-hosted.
