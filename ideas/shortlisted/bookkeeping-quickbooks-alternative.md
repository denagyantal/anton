# Simple Bookkeeping (QuickBooks Alternative) — Score: 77/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: PASS (too competitive; better as feature within vertical SaaS)
**Tier**: 1 (borderline)

## Concept
Opinionated, stripped-down bookkeeping: bank transaction categorization, invoice sending, tax-ready reports. No payroll, no inventory. AI auto-categorize. Dead-simple mobile app.

## Scoring Summary
Market Validation: 5/5 (3x=15) | Competitor Weakness: 4/5 (2x=8) | LTD Viability: 3/5 (2x=6) | No Free Tier: 2/5 (1x=2) | Channel Access: 4/5 (2x=8) | Content: 5/5 (1x=5) | AppSumo: 4/5 (2x=8) | Reviews: 4/5 (1x=4) | MRR Path: 3/5 (3x=9) | Build: 3/5 (2x=6) | Boring Bonus: 3/5 (2x=6)

## Why PASS
- Wave is free. Competing with free is brutal.
- Intuit ($100B+) and Xero are deeply funded
- Bank feed APIs are expensive and fragile
- Better to build job costing / bookkeeping as feature within vertical trades tool
