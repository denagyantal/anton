# Simple Bookkeeping / QuickBooks Alternative

**Score: 79/105** | **Verdict: EXPLORE FURTHER** | **Priority: #19**

## Concept
Opinionated, stripped-down bookkeeping tool that does 3 things well: bank transaction categorization (AI-powered), invoice sending, and tax-ready reports. No payroll, no inventory, no project management. Target the 80% of businesses using 20% of QuickBooks features.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | QBO 7M+ subscribers. "Does anyone else think QuickBooks is terrible?" — 6+ pages on Intuit's forum. |
| Competitor Weakness | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | QBO hated but dominant (80% share). Many alternatives: Xero, FreshBooks, Wave. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $59-79 LTD. Gap between free Wave and $35/mo QBO. |
| No Free Tier | 2/5 | 1x | 2 | Wave is free. Zoho has free tier. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | r/smallbusiness, r/Bookkeeping, r/accounting. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "QuickBooks alternative". Massive search volume. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Accounting tools convert on AppSumo. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Mission-critical = high expectations. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | LTD → MRR for bank feeds, payroll, advanced features. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Bank feeds, security, accounting accuracy complex. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Boring but horizontal, not vertical-specific. |

## Key Insight
Only build if uniquely positioned as vertical bookkeeping (e.g., "bookkeeping for trades" with trade-specific chart of accounts and job-based P&L). Generic bookkeeping is too crowded.

## Risks
1. QBO has 80% market share and massive ecosystem
2. Wave is free — hard to justify paid for basic bookkeeping
3. Bank feed integrations add ongoing cost
