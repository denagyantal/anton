# Field Service Management for Small Trades (TradeFlow)

**Score: 97/105** | **Verdict: BUILD** | **Priority: #1**

## Concept
Dead-simple field service tool built specifically for 1-5 technician shops. Drag-and-drop daily schedule, one-tap dispatch with GPS, mobile-first job tracking (photos, notes, time), instant invoicing from the field with payment collection, and basic customer history. Setup in 15 minutes, not 15 days. Flat pricing, no per-user fees, no annual contracts.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | ServiceTitan $9.5B valuation, Jobber $100M+ ARR, Housecall Pro acquired $585M. FSM market $5.6B → $9.7B by 2030. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | ServiceTitan $250-500/user/mo + $2-5K setup. Per-tech pricing. Annual contracts. Mitchell 1 Windows-only UI from 2003. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $89-149 LTD profitable. High perceived value vs $200-500/mo competitors. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Trades businesses expect to pay. No meaningful free tier in market. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | r/HVAC, r/Plumbing, r/electricians, r/pestcontrol, r/sweatystartup. FB groups 50K+. Trade shows, supply houses. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "HVAC scheduling software", "ServiceTitan alternative for small business". Comparison content gold. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | High perceived value. Supplemental trade channel marketing needed. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Trades owners review if it saves money and time. Strong G2/Capterra culture. |
| MRR Path | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | LTD for core → MRR for AI dispatching, route optimization, advanced reporting. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | 4-6 week MVP. Core workflow well-understood. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Peak boring: HVAC, plumbing, pest control. VCs ignore sub-$100/mo market. |

## Target Market
Solo HVAC technicians, husband-and-wife plumbing businesses, independent pest control operators, small electrical contractors. The 1-5 person shop using Google Calendar + paper invoices + QuickBooks.

## Key Differentiators
1. Flat pricing — unlimited technicians, no per-user gotcha
2. Mobile-first — built for phone use in the field, works offline
3. 15-minute setup — no onboarding calls, no setup fees
4. Month-to-month — no annual contracts

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $89 (unlimited users, unlimited jobs)
- **Tier 2**: $149 (+ inventory tracking and QuickBooks sync)

## Distribution Channels
- r/HVAC, r/Plumbing, r/electricians, r/pestcontrol, r/smallbusiness, r/sweatystartup
- Facebook: HVAC Technicians (50K+), Plumbers & Pipefitters (30K+)
- HVAC-Talk forums, trade shows (AHR Expo, PEST WORLD)
- Supply house partnerships (Ferguson, Home Depot Pro)
- AppSumo launch

## Next Steps
1. Build MVP: drag-and-drop scheduler + one-tap dispatch + mobile job tracking + instant invoicing + payment collection
2. Recruit 5-10 beta users from r/HVAC and r/Plumbing
3. Launch on AppSumo at $89/$149 tiers within 6-8 weeks
4. Simultaneously seed in trade Facebook groups and forums

## Risks
1. ServiceTitan/Jobber could launch a "lite" tier (mitigated: they can't cannibalize existing revenue)
2. Trade owners skeptical of unknown brand (mitigate: extended trial, money-back guarantee)
3. Field workers need offline capability (must be in MVP)
