## Market Data
- **Market Size**: $5.64B global FSM market (2025) → $9.68B by 2030
- **Target Segment**: 3M+ trade businesses in the US, majority with <5 employees
- **Pricing**: $29-49/mo flat. LTD at $79
- **Revenue Potential**: >$10K MRR achievable within 12 months

## Key Differentiators
1. $29-49/mo flat (no per-user or add-on creep)
2. Offline-first architecture with Android parity
3. Built-in financial tracking (eliminates QuickBooks dependency)
4. No contracts ever
5. AI scheduling (suggest next job by proximity)
6. Vertical-specific templates for HVAC, plumbing, electrical

## Next Steps
1. Pick primary trade vertical (HVAC vs plumbing vs electrical) for V1 templates
2. Build mobile-first MVP: scheduling, invoicing, payments, customer CRM
3. Pre-launch on r/HVAC and trade Facebook groups
4. Prepare AppSumo LTD at $79

## Risks
1. Feature expectations from ServiceTitan defectors may be too high
2. Offline-first architecture is technically complex
3. Jobber/HCP may cut prices in response
