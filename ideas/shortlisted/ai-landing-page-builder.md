# AI Landing Page Builder

**Evaluation Score**: 77/95 (Tier 1 — #3 Recommendation)
**Verdict**: BUILD

## One-Line Pitch
Describe your product, AI generates a conversion-optimized landing page with built-in A/B testing — Unbounce quality at 1/10th the price.

## Problem
"Unbounce is $99/mo for a landing page? That's insane for a startup." Carrd is too basic, Leadpages templates look dated, Instapage is enterprise-priced. Indie hackers and bootstrapped startups need high-converting pages without enterprise budgets.

## Evidence of Demand
- Unbounce ($99-$625/mo), Leadpages ($37-$74/mo) — proven massive market
- Landing page tools are perennial AppSumo bestsellers
- Universal startup complaint across r/startups, r/SaaS, Indie Hackers
- "I just need a high-converting landing page, not a website builder" — recurring pattern

## Competitors & Why They Fail
| Competitor | Price | Key Weakness |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Unbounce | $99-$625/mo | Very expensive, complex for simple pages |
| Leadpages | $37-$74/mo | Dated templates, limited customization |
| Instapage | $199+/mo | Enterprise-priced, overkill |
| Carrd | $9-$49/yr | Too basic, single-page only, no A/B testing |
| Framer | $5-$25/mo | More website builder than landing page tool |

- **MRR Price**: $29/mo (starter) / $59/mo (pro with advanced analytics)

- **AppSumo potential**: YES — landing page tools are top performers
- **Positioning**: "The AI landing page builder for indie hackers. Unbounce quality, 1/10th the price."

## MRR Path
LTD phase → team tier (collaboration) → agency white-label ($99/mo) → traffic-based pricing for high-volume sites

## Team Fit
- **Front-end**: Drag-drop page editor (challenging but well-understood problem)
- **Back-end**: AI integration, hosting infrastructure, A/B testing engine
- **Designer**: Template creation is critical — must be beautiful and modern
- **Generalist**: AppSumo launch, "Unbounce alternative" content marketing, #buildinpublic

## Risks
1. Page builder UX is notoriously hard to get right
2. AI-generated design quality must be excellent from day one
3. Crowded market — need strong brand and community
4. Hosting costs at scale with LTD users

## Next Steps
1. Build AI generation engine: text prompt → landing page (2 weeks)
2. Create 10 conversion-optimized templates (1 week)
3. Add A/B testing and analytics (2 weeks)
4. Beta test with 20 indie hackers from Twitter/IH
5. Launch on AppSumo with "describe your product, get a landing page in 60 seconds" hook
