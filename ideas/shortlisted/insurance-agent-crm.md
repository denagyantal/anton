# Insurance Agency Lightweight CRM — Score: 78/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-24
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER

## One-Line Pitch

Simple policy tracker and renewal pipeline for solo insurance agents: replace your spreadsheet for $79-99 one-time.

## LTD Price

$79-99 (CRM portion; carrier integrations as MRR add-on)

## Market

- 400K+ licensed agents in the US
- 36K+ independent agencies
- Applied Epic costs $1,100+/mo
- Independent channel writes 60%+ of P&C premiums

## Key Differentiators

- Lightweight tool (not a full AMS replacement)
- Renewal pipeline with 60/30/15-day alerts
- ACORD form auto-fill
- Communication log per client
- Commission tracking
- CSV import for easy switching from spreadsheets

## Target Channels

- Insurance Forums
- r/Insurance
- Independent agency associations

## Top 3 Risks

1. Insurance is heavily regulated, adding compliance burden
2. Carrier integrations are gatekept and difficult to obtain
3. Hard to reach agents -- channels are fragmented with no single community

## Verdict

EXPLORE FURTHER -- The gap between spreadsheets and $1,100/mo AMS platforms is real. Focus on the lightweight CRM use case and avoid full policy administration.
