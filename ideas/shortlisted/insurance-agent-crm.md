**Score: 83/105** | **Verdict: EXPLORE FURTHER** | **Priority: #14**

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Applied Epic, EZLynx, HawkSoft all have paying users. 400K+ agents in US. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | "Locked into EZLynx hell." QQ: 5 steps for simple tasks. Agents "copy-pasting more than selling." |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $79-99 LTD. One-time fee disrupts monthly AMS pricing. |
| No Free Tier | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | No free insurance AMS. |
| Channel Access | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | r/Insurance 200K+, insurance forums, conferences. Professional/niche. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "EZLynx alternative", "insurance agent CRM". |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Agents less on AppSumo. Industry channels needed. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Agents review AMS extensively on insurance forums. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Ongoing policy tracking need. LTD → MRR for carrier integrations, team features. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Carrier integrations complex. Basic CRM/tracker in 4-6 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Deeply boring — insurance agency operations. |

## Key Differentiators
1. Built for independent agents, not agencies with 50+ staff
2. Commission tracking (know what you're owed)
3. Policy renewal alerts prevent lost clients
4. Mobile-first for agents on the go

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $79 (solo agent, unlimited policies)
- **Tier 2**: $99 (+ team features, carrier appointment tracking, advanced reporting)

## Next Steps
1. Validate demand in insurance forums — survey independent agents
2. MVP: policy tracker + renewal reminders + commission tracker + client log
3. Skip carrier integrations for v1

## Risks
1. Carrier integrations are the real value but extremely complex
2. Insurance compliance varies by state
3. Agents resist switching established AMS
