| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Per-agent, carrier integrations, commission tracking premium. |

## Next Steps
1. MVP: policy expiration dashboard, renewal reminders, client log, commission tracker
2. Skip carrier integrations in v1
3. Validate with 5 independent agents

## Risks
1. Carrier integrations are complex
2. Applied Epic dominance creates switching costs
3. Insurance regulation varies by state
