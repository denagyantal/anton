**Score: 85/105** | **Verdict: BUILD** | **Priority: #7**

## Concept
Cloud-based auto shop management for independent mechanics and 1-3 bay shops. Create estimates and work orders in 60 seconds. Built-in DVI (photo/video inspections sent to customer via text). Customer texting for approvals and updates. Basic inventory tracking. Native QuickBooks sync. All built-in, no add-ons.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | Mitchell 1, Tekmetric, Shopmonkey all have paying customers. $1.5-2.5B market → $3.2-5.3B by 2032. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Mitchell 1 Windows-only. Shop4D $1,100/mo crashes daily. 56% find tools cost-prohibitive. No product in $79-149/mo range. |
| LTD Viability | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | $99-179 or $299-499 LTD. Higher price due to complexity. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | ARI cheapest at $40-60/mo. No meaningful free tier. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | r/MechanicAdvice 800K+, Diagnostic Network, Garage Journal, iATN. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "auto repair shop software", "Mitchell 1 alternative", "Shopmonkey alternative". |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Auto shop owners less on AppSumo. Direct industry marketing better. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Mechanics review extensively on Diagnostic Network and forums. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | LTD → MRR for parts supplier integrations, advanced DVI, multi-location. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | 6-8 week MVP. DVI and parts integration add scope. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Deeply boring — auto repair shops. |

## Target Market
Independent mechanics, 1-3 bay shops, mobile mechanics, specialty shops. The mechanic who opened their own shop and tracks work orders on paper or whiteboard.

## Key Differentiators
1. Price: $79-149/mo vs $200-400/mo competitors (the "dead zone" product)
2. DVI included, not a $100/mo add-on
3. Customer texting built-in
4. Native QuickBooks sync (not a third-party connector that breaks)
5. No contracts, 5-minute guided onboarding

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $299 (single shop, unlimited work orders, DVI, texting)
- **Tier 2**: $499 (+ parts integration, advanced reporting)

## Next Steps
1. MVP: work order creation + DVI (photo inspections) + customer texting + invoicing + QuickBooks sync
2. Skip parts integration for v1 — add after validation
3. Market through Diagnostic Network, iATN, mechanic Facebook groups

## Risks
1. Parts database integration is a moat but also a barrier
2. Mechanics skeptical of new software (mitigate: data migration help)
3. Higher build complexity than simpler ideas
