# Auto Repair Shop Management — Score: 88/105

**Verdict**: BUILD (scope carefully — start with RO + invoicing + texting, DVI in v2)
**LTD Price**: $499
**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-24

## One-Line Pitch

Modern, affordable shop management for 1-3 bay independent shops at $69/mo or $499 one-time.

## Market

- $3.4B market (2026), growing to $8.6B by 2033 at 9.2% CAGR (fastest-growing segment)
- 303K auto mechanic shops in the US; SMEs account for 62% of revenue
- Massive pricing gap between bare-bones tools and feature-complete platforms

## Key Differentiators

- $69/mo all-inclusive with no per-user fees (vs. Tekmetric $199+/mo, Shopmonkey $179+/mo)
- Offline-capable for shops with unreliable internet
- 2-way customer texting included (most competitors charge extra or lack it)
- Reliable QuickBooks sync (a top pain point in competitor reviews)
- Vendor-neutral parts ordering (no lock-in to a single parts supplier)

## Target Channels

- r/MechanicAdvice
- r/AutoMechanic
- Diagnostic Network forums
- iATN (International Automotive Technicians Network)
- ASA (Automotive Service Association) local chapters

## Top 3 Risks

1. **Tekmetric well-liked** — strong incumbent with good reviews; need clear differentiation on price and simplicity
2. **Parts database integration complex** — connecting to multiple parts catalogs (AutoZone, O'Reilly, NAPA, Worldpac) is technically demanding
3. **Build complexity may exceed 6 weeks** — RO workflow, invoicing, texting, and QuickBooks sync together are substantial; must ruthlessly cut scope for v1

## Verdict

BUILD. The market is large ($3.4B), growing fast (9.2% CAGR), and independent shops are underserved by current pricing. A $499 LTD or $69/mo price point with no per-user fees directly addresses the most common complaints. Start with repair orders, invoicing, and texting; add DVI (digital vehicle inspection) in v2.
