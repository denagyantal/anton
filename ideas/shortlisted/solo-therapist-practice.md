# Solo Therapist Practice Management

**Score**: 83/105
**Verdict**: BUILD (with HIPAA expertise)
**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-24

## One-Line Pitch

HIPAA-compliant practice tool with AI SOAP notes: save 30+ min/day on admin for $99 one-time.

## LTD Price

$99 (AI notes as usage-based add-on)

## Market

- 400K+ licensed mental health counselors in the US
- SimplePractice raised $370M (validates massive demand)
- Reddit analysis: 656 health/wellness app requests
- Competitors charge $49-99/mo; massive LTD arbitrage opportunity

## Key Differentiators

- AI voice-to-SOAP notes (saves 30+ min/day)
- Stripped-down for solo practitioners (no group features)
- Stripe billing + insurance superbill generation
- Secure client portal
- HIPAA-compliant architecture

## Target Channels

- r/therapists
- r/psychotherapy
- r/privatepractice
- Therapy association partnerships

## Top 3 Risks

1. HIPAA compliance requires specific expertise and ongoing vigilance
2. SimplePractice has massive brand recognition and network effects
3. Insurance integration is complex and varies by state

## Verdict

BUILD -- with HIPAA expertise on the team. AI SOAP notes are a genuine time-saver that solo therapists are actively requesting. Strong differentiation against bloated incumbents.
