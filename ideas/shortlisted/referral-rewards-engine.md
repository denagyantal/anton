# Referral Rewards Engine

**Evaluation Score**: 76/95 (Tier 1 — #4)
**Verdict**: BUILD

## One-Line Pitch
Simple referral program builder for any business — custom links, automated rewards, and tracking dashboard. No coding, no enterprise pricing.

## Problem
Small businesses know referrals are their best channel but have no way to systematically incentivize and track them. Manual tracking with spreadsheets. Enterprise referral tools start at $59-$99/mo. Nothing affordable and universal.

## Evidence of Demand
- GrowthPanels hit $2K MRR in just 2 months — fast market validation
- ReferralCandy ($59/mo), GrowSurf ($99/mo) — proven demand at higher price points
- Universal small business need across all industries
- Frequent r/smallbusiness posts about referral program tools

## Our Product
- **Referral link generator**: Custom branded links per customer
- **Reward automation**: Auto-apply discounts, credits, or cash via Stripe
- **Tracking dashboard**: See who referred whom, conversion rates, top referrers
- **Embeddable widget**: Add referral program to any website in 2 minutes
- **Email notifications**: Alert customers when they earn rewards
- **Works for any business**: Service businesses, SaaS, e-commerce, local shops

## Go-To-Market
- **LTD Price**: $59 (unlimited referrals and customers)
- **MRR Price**: $19/mo after LTD phase
- **Target channels**: r/smallbusiness, r/Entrepreneur, small business Facebook groups, AppSumo
- **AppSumo potential**: YES — growth tools are top sellers

## Risks
1. Low barrier to entry (easy to clone)
2. Need strong Stripe/payment integrations for stickiness
3. Customer onboarding must be dead simple

## Next Steps
1. Build referral link + tracking MVP with Stripe integration (2 weeks)
2. Add embeddable widget (1 week)
3. Target service businesses (coaches, consultants, cleaners) as first niche
4. AppSumo launch with "grow through word-of-mouth" positioning
