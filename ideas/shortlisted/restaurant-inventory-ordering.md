# Restaurant Inventory & Food Cost Tracker — Score: 84/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: BUILD
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
POS-agnostic inventory tool: scan supplier invoices with phone camera (OCR) to auto-update inventory. Set par levels with reorder alerts. Track food cost percentage per menu item. Waste logging. One-tap vendor ordering via text/email. No hardware required.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | MarketMan ($239+/mo), xtraCHEF, BlueCart. 1M+ restaurants, 70% independent. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | MarketMan enterprise-priced. Toast overkill. POS-locked alternatives. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $79-99 LTD. OCR costs moderate. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Restaurant tools are paid. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | r/restaurateur, r/KitchenConfidential (1M+ combined). |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "restaurant inventory management", "food cost tracker." |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Restaurant owners less on AppSumo. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "Saves money on food waste" = measurable ROI. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | OCR usage, vendor integrations, multi-location premium. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | OCR + inventory + par levels + food cost in 3-4 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Restaurant inventory — deeply boring. |

## Next Steps
1. MVP: invoice OCR scanning, inventory tracking, par levels, food cost per dish
2. POS-agnostic — works with any POS
3. "Pays for itself in one month of reduced waste"
4. Seed with 5 independent restaurants

## Risks
1. Restaurant industry is price-sensitive and high-churn
2. OCR accuracy on varied invoices is hard
3. Toast's xtraCHEF could bundle this free
