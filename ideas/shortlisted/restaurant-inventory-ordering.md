# Restaurant Inventory & Ordering for Small Independents

**Score: 81/105** | **Verdict: EXPLORE FURTHER** | **Priority: #16**

## Concept
Standalone inventory + ordering tool (not a POS) that works alongside any existing POS. Scan invoices from suppliers with OCR to auto-update inventory. Set par levels and get reorder alerts. Track food cost percentage automatically. Simple vendor ordering via text/email. No hardware required.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | MarketMan $239+/mo, Toast, Square. 1M+ restaurants, 70% independent. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Toast overkill. MarketMan expensive. POS lock-in. No good standalone inventory. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $79-99 LTD for standalone inventory. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Limited free options. |
| Channel Access | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | r/restaurateur, r/KitchenConfidential 1M+ combined but busy audience. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "restaurant inventory management", "food cost tracking". |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Restaurant owners less on AppSumo. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Restaurants extremely busy — harder to get reviews. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | LTD → MRR for supplier integrations, waste analytics, multi-location. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | 4-6 weeks. OCR + par levels + alerts + food cost tracking. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Deeply boring — counting inventory in a walk-in cooler. |

## Key Differentiators
1. POS-agnostic — works with Toast, Square, or no POS
2. OCR invoice scanning — snap a photo, auto-update inventory
3. Food cost percentage tracking (the metric restaurants care about)
4. No hardware required

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $79 (single location, unlimited items)
- **Tier 2**: $99 (+ supplier integrations, waste tracking, multi-location)

## Risks
1. Restaurant failure rate → customer churn
2. Toast may bundle free inventory
3. Restaurant owners notoriously hard to sell to
