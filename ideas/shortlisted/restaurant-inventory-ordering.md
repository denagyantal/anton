# Restaurant Recipe Costing & Menu Profitability — Score: 88/105

**Verdict**: BUILD
**LTD Price**: $69-89
**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-24

## One-Line Pitch

Know your food cost percentage in real-time, not at month-end. Standalone recipe costing for $69-89 one-time.

## Market

- 1M+ restaurants in the US, 70% independent
- MarketMan starts at $239+/mo — massive price gap for independents
- Average restaurant profit margin is 3-5%; small food cost savings have outsized impact

## Key Differentiators

- Standalone tool with no POS lock-in (works alongside any POS system)
- OCR invoice scanning for automatic ingredient price updates
- Per-dish cost calculation with real-time margin tracking
- Profit margin flagging (alerts when a dish drops below target margin)
- Works alongside Toast, Square, Clover, or no POS at all

## Target Channels

- r/restaurateur
- r/KitchenConfidential
- Food service conferences and trade shows
- Restaurant owner Facebook groups

## Top 3 Risks

1. **Limited MRR path** — a $69-89 LTD is attractive but makes recurring revenue transition harder without clear upgrade hooks
2. **Toast/Square ecosystem lock-in** — POS giants are expanding into back-of-house tools; restaurants already in their ecosystem may not look elsewhere
3. **Ingredient price volatility** — produce, protein, and dairy prices shift weekly; OCR accuracy and price update frequency must be reliable to maintain trust

## Verdict

BUILD. The pain is acute (3-5% margins mean every dollar of food cost matters), the incumbent pricing is prohibitive for independents ($239+/mo), and a standalone tool avoids the POS lock-in problem. The $69-89 LTD is an easy impulse buy for any restaurant owner who has ever been surprised by month-end food cost numbers.
