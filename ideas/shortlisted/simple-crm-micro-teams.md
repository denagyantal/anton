# Simple CRM for Micro-Teams (1-10 people)

**Evaluation Score**: 81/95 (Tier 1 — #1 Recommendation)
**Verdict**: BUILD

## One-Line Pitch
Zero-input CRM that auto-captures emails, calls, and meetings — setup in 5 minutes, not 5 weeks.

## Problem
Real estate agents and small sales teams complain about bloated CRMs that take weeks to set up. "CRMs track what managers want, not what salespeople need." Users are "sold platforms stuffed with features they don't use while basics like managing hot leads or syncing with email remain clunky."

## Evidence of Demand
- CRM is a $65B+ market
- Hundreds of complaint posts across r/smallbusiness, r/sales, r/realestate
- Salesforce/HubSpot price hikes driving users to seek alternatives
- SimplePractice, Pipedrive, Close all have significant complaint threads

## Competitors & Why They Fail
| Competitor | Price | Key Weakness |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Salesforce | $25-$300/user/mo | Massively overbuilt, weeks to set up |
| HubSpot | Free-$120/user/mo | Paid tiers expensive, aggressive feature gating |
| Pipedrive | $14-$99/user/mo | Limited marketing features, integrations cost extra |
| Close | $29-$139/user/mo | Expensive at scale |
| Zoho CRM | $14-$52/user/mo | Dated UI, steep learning curve |

## Our Product
- Auto-capture: Connect email + calendar, all interactions logged automatically
- Zero data entry: AI extracts contacts, notes, and follow-ups
- Visual pipeline: Drag-and-drop deal stages
- Smart reminders: AI suggests next actions based on conversation history
- Mobile-first: Works beautifully on phone (where salespeople live)
- Setup in 5 minutes: Opinionated defaults, no 200-field customization

## Go-To-Market
- **LTD Price**: $79 (single user) / $149 (team of 5)
- **MRR Price**: $19/user/mo after LTD phase
- **Target channels**: r/sales, r/realestate, r/smallbusiness, realtor Facebook groups, AppSumo
- **AppSumo potential**: YES — CRM alternatives are proven top sellers
- **First niche**: Real estate agents (clear workflow, large community, willing to pay)

## MRR Path
LTD phase → team plan (per-seat) → enterprise features for growing teams → API/integrations marketplace

## Team Fit
- **Front-end**: Standard dashboard + pipeline UI (manageable)
- **Back-end**: Email/calendar API integration (moderate-hard), AI processing
- **Designer**: Clean, modern CRM interface
- **Generalist**: Reddit/AppSumo launch, content marketing ("best CRM for [niche]")

## Risks
1. Crowded market — differentiation through "zero-input" is critical
2. Email API complexity (Gmail, Outlook) — reliability challenges
3. Data migration from existing CRMs — need import tools

## Next Steps
1. Build email/calendar auto-capture MVP (2 weeks)
2. Add visual pipeline + AI follow-up suggestions (2 weeks)
3. Beta test with 20 real estate agents from r/realestate
4. Launch on AppSumo with "anti-Salesforce" positioning
