# Gym & Fitness Studio Management — Score: 76/105

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**LTD Price**: $99-149
**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-27

## One-Line Pitch

Simple, affordable gym and studio management for independent fitness businesses — class scheduling, member management, and payments without MindBody complexity.

## Market

- $63.94B gym management software market
- MindBody $159+/mo dominant but bloated
- Glofox, GymDesk, Zen Planner, Mariana Tek serve mid-market
- Thousands of independent yoga studios, martial arts schools, CrossFit boxes, and boutique gyms

## Key Differentiators

- Flat-rate pricing vs. MindBody's per-location tiered model
- Simple UX focused on class scheduling + member management + payments
- No hardware requirements (unlike some gym-specific tools)
- Modality-specific templates (yoga, martial arts, CrossFit, Pilates)
- Built-in waiver management and automated billing

## Target Channels

- r/personaltraining, r/yoga, r/martialarts
- MindBody refugee communities (studio owners actively seeking alternatives)
- Fitness studio owner Facebook groups
- AppSumo (fitness studio owners are price-sensitive)

## Top 3 Risks

1. **Not boring enough** — fitness/wellness is somewhat trendy, attracting VC-funded competitors (Glofox, ABC Fitness)
2. **Complex product requirements** — member app, class scheduling, payment processing, access control, waitlists all expected
3. **MindBody has massive brand recognition** — despite complaints, switching costs are high for established studios

## Verdict

EXPLORE FURTHER. The market is massive ($63.94B) and MindBody dissatisfaction is real, but fitness is not a boring business — it attracts competition and VC funding. Best approach would be to pick a specific modality (martial arts or yoga) and build a hyper-focused tool for that niche before expanding.
