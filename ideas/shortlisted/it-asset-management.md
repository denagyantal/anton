## Scoring

| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $79-129 LTD for MSPs. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Snipe-IT open source/free. |

| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | LTD → MRR for active scanning, integrations, compliance. |

## Key Differentiators
1. Cloud-native (vs Snipe-IT's self-hosted)
2. Better UX than open source alternatives
3. Automated discovery and scanning
4. Built for MSPs managing multiple client environments

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $79 (up to 100 assets)
- **Tier 2**: $129 (unlimited assets, automated scanning, multi-client)

## Risks
1. Snipe-IT is free (mitigate: cloud convenience, better UX)
2. MSP market is tech-savvy with high expectations
3. Enterprise vendors may launch SMB tiers
