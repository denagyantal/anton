# Healthcare Practice Digital Intake & Communication

**Score: 79/105** | **Verdict: EXPLORE FURTHER** | **Priority: #21**

## Concept
Affordable ($49-99/mo) patient communication for solo/small practices. Automated text reminders, digital intake forms with EHR integration, 2-way texting, review requests after visits, and recall campaigns. The "Mailchimp for healthcare practices."

## Scoring

| LTD Viability | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Ongoing SMS costs. Hybrid usage model needed. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | No free healthcare communication platforms. |
| Channel Access | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Healthcare communities fragmented by specialty. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "Weave alternative", "patient communication software". |
| AppSumo Fit | 2/5 | 2x | 4 | Healthcare pros rarely on AppSumo. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Healthcare cautious about public recommendations. |
| MRR Path | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | SMS = natural recurring. Per-practice monthly. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | HIPAA, EHR integrations add complexity. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Unglamorous professional services. |

## Key Insight
Consider narrowing to single specialty (dental — see separate shortlist, or veterinary) rather than broad healthcare. Specialty-specific tools can charge more and build deeper moats.

## Risks
1. HIPAA compliance non-negotiable
2. EHR integration landscape is fragmented
3. Weave has strong incumbent position
