# Equipment & Maintenance Tracking for Trades

**Score: 78/105** | **Verdict: EXPLORE FURTHER** | **Priority: #22**

## Concept
Track equipment maintenance schedules, warranty expiration, service history, and replacement planning for trades with expensive equipment (HVAC units, plumbing tools, construction equipment). Prevent costly breakdowns. Maintain compliance (EPA, OSHA).

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | HN Micasa (621 pts) validates. Few purpose-built tools. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Almost no SMB competition. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $79-99 LTD. Prevent one breakdown = pays for itself. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | No free options. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Trade channels. |
| Content Potential | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Niche keywords. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Niche but compelling ROI. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Reactive value. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | May be a feature, not standalone. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | 2-3 weeks. Simple tracker. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Peak boring. |

## Key Insight
Best as a module within FSM (TradeFlow) or Property Management (LandlordPad) rather than standalone product. Standalone revenue potential is uncertain.

## Risks
1. May not work as standalone product
2. Low urgency until equipment actually breaks
3. Competes with simple spreadsheets and calendar reminders
