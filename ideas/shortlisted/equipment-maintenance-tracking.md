# Equipment & Maintenance Tracking — Score: 77/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER (better as FSM feature)
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Equipment lifecycle management for trades: maintenance reminders, service logs, warranty tracking, compliance cert expiration alerts. Per-equipment tracking. "Preventing one $40K HVAC unit breakdown pays for the tool."

## Scoring Summary
Market Validation: 3/5 (3x=9) | Competitor Weakness: 3/5 (2x=6) | LTD Viability: 5/5 (2x=10) | No Free Tier: 3/5 (1x=3) | Channel Access: 4/5 (2x=8) | Content: 3/5 (1x=3) | AppSumo: 3/5 (2x=6) | Reviews: 3/5 (1x=3) | MRR Path: 3/5 (3x=9) | Build: 5/5 (2x=10) | Boring Bonus: 5/5 (2x=10)

## Next Steps
1. Better as add-on module within FSM product
2. Standalone: target construction companies with expensive equipment
3. "Preventing one breakdown pays for the tool"

## Risks
- May be too narrow standalone
- Free/generic trackers exist
- Reactive market (adopt after a costly breakdown)
