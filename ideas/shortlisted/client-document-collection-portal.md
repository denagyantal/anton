# Client Document Collection Portal — Score: 86/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: BUILD (quick-win)
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Simple document collection portal: create checklist of needed documents per client, send branded link, client uploads, auto-reminders for missing items, expiration dates for time-sensitive docs, dashboard showing completion status across all clients. Industry-specific templates (tax prep, insurance, loan, legal).

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Content Snare $1M+ ARR. TaxDome includes this. SmartVault, Liscio adjacent. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Content Snare agency-focused. TaxDome bundles too much ($50-100/user/mo). |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $59-79 LTD. Minimal ongoing costs. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Google Forms could substitute. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | r/taxpros, r/accounting, r/Insurance. Cross-industry. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "client document collection", "Content Snare alternative." |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Professional tools convert well. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Saves hours chasing documents. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | Limited upsell. E-sig, storage, client portal as premium. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Checklist + upload + reminders + dashboard in 2-3 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Document collection — deeply boring. |

## Next Steps
1. MVP: checklist builder, branded upload link, auto-reminders, completion dashboard
2. Templates for tax, insurance, mortgage, legal
3. AppSumo in September (pre-tax season) at $59-79
4. Cross-sell to any professional services buyer

## Risks
1. Simple tool — easy to clone
2. Too narrow for long-term standalone
3. Google Forms is "good enough" for some
