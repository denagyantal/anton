**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23

## Next Steps
1. Target ONE trade for v1 (HVAC or plumbing — largest communities)
2. MVP: daily schedule, dispatch with GPS, mobile job tracking, field invoicing, QuickBooks sync
3. Position as "anti-ServiceTitan" — 10-minute setup, flat pricing, no contracts
4. Seed 10 beta users from r/HVAC or HVAC-Talk
5. AppSumo at $89-149 + trade forum blitz

## Risks
1. Crowded market (Jobber, HCP, FieldPulse) — must nail "simple + affordable"
2. QuickBooks sync reliability is table stakes — #1 complaint across competitors
3. Offline mobile capability adds complexity
