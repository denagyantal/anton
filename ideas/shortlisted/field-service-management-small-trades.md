## Scoring Breakdown

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | ServiceTitan ($8B valuation), Housecall Pro ($585M acquisition), Jobber ($100M+ ARR). Massive proven market. 6+ Reddit threads, multiple HN discussions. People paying $200-500/mo. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | ServiceTitan too expensive ($245-398/mo + $2-5K setup), Jobber/HCP moving upmarket with per-tech pricing. "Costs more than my truck payment" is the dominant complaint. 1-5 truck shops are abandoned. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $89-149 LTD is profitable -- core features (scheduling, dispatch, invoicing) use standard APIs. Infrastructure cost per user is low. Plumbers have real budgets. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Trades businesses expect to pay for tools. No free-tier expectation in this market. Yardbook (free) is an outlier in landscaping, not FSM. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | r/HVAC, r/Plumbing, r/electricians, r/pestcontrol, r/smallbusiness. Facebook: HVAC Technicians (50K+), Plumbers & Pipefitters (30K+). HVAC-Talk forums. Supply house partnerships. YouTube: HVAC School, Roger Wakefield. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Strong SEO: "best field service app for small business", "ServiceTitan alternative for small companies", "HVAC scheduling software". Comparison content writes itself. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | High perceived value ($200+/mo competitors make $89 LTD a steal). AppSumo audience skews tech, but trades owners are pragmatic deal-seekers. Need supplemental trade-community marketing. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Trades owners are active reviewers when they like something (see Jobber's 600+ G2 reviews). If the tool saves them time daily, they will review. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Clear: LTD for base features, MRR for advanced (AI dispatching, inventory, multi-location, QuickBooks sync, payment processing fees). Usage-based SMS/notifications add recurring. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Core MVP (scheduling + dispatch + invoicing + customer DB + mobile) in 4-6 weeks with 3-4 devs. Mapping APIs (Google Maps), payment (Stripe), notifications (Twilio). Well-understood problem. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Peak boring. Plumbing, HVAC, pest control, electrical. Blue-collar trades. |
| **TOTAL** | | | **88/105** | |

## Next Steps

1. Validate with 10 small HVAC/plumbing business owners (cold outreach on Reddit/Facebook)
2. Build clickable prototype focusing on mobile-first daily schedule + one-tap dispatch + field invoicing
3. Pre-sell on r/HVAC and HVAC Facebook groups before building
4. Plan AppSumo launch for month 2-3

## Risks

1. **Incumbent price cuts**: Competing with well-funded incumbents (Jobber, HCP) who could slash prices for small operators
2. **Mobile quality bar**: Mobile app quality must be exceptional -- trades workers live on their phones in the field
3. **QuickBooks integration**: QuickBooks sync is table-stakes and has documented sync issues across all competitors

## Product Concept

**Working name**: "TradeFlow"

**LTD price point**: $89 (unlimited users, unlimited jobs) / $149 (+ inventory tracking and QuickBooks sync)

**Target channels**: r/HVAC, r/Plumbing, r/electricians, r/pestcontrol, r/smallbusiness, Facebook groups for trade businesses (HVAC Technicians group - 50K+ members, Plumbers & Pipefitters - 30K+ members), HVAC-Talk forums, trade shows (AHR Expo, PEST WORLD), supply house bulletin boards
