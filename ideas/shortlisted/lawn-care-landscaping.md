## Target Market
Lawn care operators, landscapers, mowing services with 1-10 crew members. The operator who mows 30-50 lawns per week on a route.

## Key Differentiators
1. Route-optimized scheduling (minimize drive time between properties)
2. Seasonal contract management (spring/summer/fall/winter pricing)
3. Property measurement via satellite (Google Maps integration)
4. Before/after photo documentation per property per visit
5. Built exclusively for green industry, not generic FSM

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $69 (solo operator, unlimited properties)
- **Tier 2**: $89 (+ crew management, route optimization, advanced reporting)

## Next Steps
1. Build MVP: route-optimized weekly scheduling + recurring job templates + before/after photos + auto-invoicing
2. Time AppSumo launch for February-March (pre-season buying)
3. Distribute through LawnSite.com, r/lawncare, landscaping FB groups
4. Expand to snow removal for winter revenue

## Risks
1. Jobber is "good enough" for many (mitigate: purpose-built features they can't match)
2. Highly seasonal revenue (mitigate: snow removal module)
3. Route optimization technically complex to do well
