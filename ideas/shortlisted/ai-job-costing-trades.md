# AI-Powered Job Costing & Profitability for Trades

**Score: 80/105** | **Verdict: EXPLORE FURTHER** | **Priority: #18**

## Concept
Simple, mobile-first job costing for 1-20 person trades businesses. Create job → track hours (GPS clock in/out) → photograph material receipts (AI extracts and categorizes) → real-time job profitability. Monthly dashboard: most/least profitable job types.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | Knowify $149-599/mo, Foundation Software (enterprise). Few purpose-built SMB tools. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Expensive, enterprise-focused. No simple mobile option. QBO poor at job costing. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $89-119 LTD. "Stop taking unprofitable jobs" is compelling ROI. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | No free job costing tools. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Same trade channels. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "job costing software for contractors", "is my business profitable". |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Compelling ROI pitch. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "I realized 30% of my jobs were unprofitable" = powerful reviews. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | Could be a feature not standalone. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | 3-4 weeks. Time tracking + receipt OCR + job costing math. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Accounting meets trades. Peak boring. |

## Key Insight
Best positioned as a module within the FSM (TradeFlow) platform rather than standalone. Consider building as a free "profitability calculator" lead magnet first.

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $89 (up to 10 active jobs, 5 users)
- **Tier 2**: $119 (unlimited jobs/users, AI receipt scanning, advanced reports)

## Risks
1. May not stand alone — better as FSM feature
2. AI receipt categorization accuracy must be very high
3. Trades owners may not want to see true profitability
