# AI Job Costing for Trades — Score: 81/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER (better as FSM feature)
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Simple, mobile-first job costing for 1-20 person trades businesses. Create job → track hours (GPS clock in/out) → photograph material receipts (AI OCR) → real-time job profitability. "This job was estimated at $3,200, actual cost was $2,100, profit margin 34%." Monthly dashboard of most/least profitable job types.

## Scoring Summary
Market Validation: 3/5 (3x=9) | Competitor Weakness: 4/5 (2x=8) | LTD Viability: 4/5 (2x=8) | No Free Tier: 4/5 (1x=4) | Channel Access: 4/5 (2x=8) | Content: 4/5 (1x=4) | AppSumo: 3/5 (2x=6) | Reviews: 4/5 (1x=4) | MRR Path: 4/5 (3x=12) | Build: 4/5 (2x=8) | Boring Bonus: 5/5 (2x=10)

## Next Steps
1. Consider as feature of FSM rather than standalone
2. MVP: job creation + time tracking + receipt OCR + profitability dashboard
3. "Stop taking unprofitable jobs" — compelling ROI pitch

## Risks
- May be too narrow standalone
- Receipt OCR accuracy varies
- Trades owners may resist tracking
