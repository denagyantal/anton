# Tax Preparer Client Portal & Document Collection — Score: 87/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: BUILD (time to Oct launch)
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Standalone client portal for tax preparers: secure document upload with checklist tracking, e-signatures for engagement letters and 8879s, automated reminders for missing documents, year-round secure messaging, tax organizer questionnaires. Integrates with Drake/Lacerte/ProSeries at file system level. Don't replace tax software — solve client communication.

## Next Steps
1. MVP: branded portal, document checklist, upload, auto-reminders, e-signatures, messaging
2. Industry templates (tax prep, insurance, mortgage, legal)
3. AppSumo launch September-October

## Risks
1. Seasonal revenue (Jan-Apr peak)
2. TaxDome expanding rapidly
3. High security expectations for tax documents
