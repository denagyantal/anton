# Tax Professional Workflow Manager

**Score: 79/105** | **Verdict: EXPLORE FURTHER** | **Priority: #20**

## Concept
Lightweight tax season workflow tool: client portal for document upload, automated reminders for missing docs, status dashboard (received/in-progress/review/filed), e-signature for engagement letters, secure messaging. Complements Drake/Lacerte — doesn't replace tax software.
