# Small Fleet Trucking TMS — Score: 83/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Dead-simple TMS for small fleets: drag-and-drop dispatch board, driver mobile app for POD capture, automated IFTA mileage calculation, one-click invoicing from BOL, driver settlement calculator, basic load board integration. Instant setup — no implementation project. For 97% of fleets with <20 trucks.

## Next Steps
1. MVP: dispatch board, driver app (POD), IFTA calculator, invoicing
2. Target owner-operators first
3. Validate on r/trucking

## Risks
1. ELD compliance knowledge needed
2. Ascend TMS free tier
3. Load board integration is complex
