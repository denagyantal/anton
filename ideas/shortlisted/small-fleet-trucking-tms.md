# Small Fleet Trucking Compliance & IFTA

**Score**: 81/105
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-24

## One-Line Pitch

Compliance-first dashboard for owner-operators: IFTA auto-calculation, driver documents, DOT audit prep for $99 one-time.

## LTD Price

$99 per fleet (up to 5 trucks)

## Market

- 500K+ trucking companies in the US, 97% operate fewer than 20 trucks
- $875B+ US trucking market
- AscendTMS: 57K+ companies on platform (validates demand for affordable tools)

## Key Differentiators

- Compliance-first approach (not dispatch-first like most TMS)
- IFTA auto-calculation from fuel receipts
- Driver document tracking with expiration alerts
- DOT inspection prep dashboard
- No hardware required

## Target Channels

- r/trucking (200K+)
- r/logistics
- Trucking association chapters

## Top 3 Risks

1. Trucking compliance requires deep domain knowledge to build correctly
2. Truckbase (modern, funded startup) competes directly in this space
3. FMCSA regulatory changes could require frequent product updates

## Verdict

EXPLORE FURTHER -- strong pain point and clear willingness to pay, but requires domain expertise and regulatory vigilance. IFTA quarterly filing deadlines create natural purchase triggers. Worth validating with 10-20 owner-operator interviews before committing to build.
