# Home Inspection Software — Score: 78/105

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**LTD Price**: $79-99
**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-27

## One-Line Pitch

Mobile-first home inspection app with checklist-driven report generation, photo annotation, and client portal for $79-99 one-time.

## Market

- 30K+ home inspectors in the US (ASHI + InterNACHI members)
- Spectora ($79+/mo), Home Inspector Pro (desktop-first), HomeGauge (dated)
- Average inspection fee $300-500 — software cost is a clear business expense

## Key Differentiators

- Mobile-first with offline capability (inspectors work in basements/attics with no signal)
- Checklist-driven report generation with photo annotation
- Template library for different inspection types (full home, radon, mold, pre-listing)
- Client portal with branded report delivery
- Flat-rate pricing vs. Spectora's per-month model

## Target Channels

- InterNACHI and ASHI member communities
- Home inspection forums and Facebook groups
- r/homeinspectors
- Home inspector training/certification programs

## Top 3 Risks

1. **Spectora is well-reviewed and growing** — harder competitive entry than most boring business categories
2. **Small TAM (30K inspectors)** — limits scale potential; may cap below $10K MRR target
3. **Report template creation requires domain expertise** — different states/regions have different standards and disclosure requirements

## Verdict

EXPLORE FURTHER. The market is proven and the pain is real (inspectors paying $79+/mo for software they use per-inspection), but the small TAM and strong incumbent (Spectora) make this a riskier bet. Best suited as a secondary product or test market for a multi-vertical strategy.
