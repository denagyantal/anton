# Affordable Helpdesk ("Anti-Intercom")

**Evaluation Score**: 72/95 (Tier 1 — #7)
**Verdict**: BUILD

## One-Line Pitch
Modern shared inbox with AI auto-replies, live chat, and knowledge base at flat pricing — no per-agent gotcha. Intercom at 1/20th the cost.

## Problem
"Intercom costs more than our entire marketing budget." Per-agent pricing punishes growing teams. Startups need a shared inbox with basic automation at a predictable price, not an enterprise platform.

## Evidence of Demand
- Intercom ($39-$139/seat), Zendesk ($19-$115/agent) — massive proven market
- Dozens of r/startups, r/SaaS posts about Intercom being too expensive
- Helpdesk alternatives are proven AppSumo winners

## Our Product
- **Shared inbox**: All customer emails in one place
- **Live chat widget**: Embeddable chat for any website
- **AI auto-replies**: Suggest or auto-send responses based on knowledge base
- **Knowledge base**: Self-serve help center
- **Canned responses**: Templates for common questions
- **Flat pricing**: Up to 10 agents, unlimited conversations

## Go-To-Market
- **LTD Price**: $89 (up to 10 agents, unlimited conversations)
- **MRR Price**: $39/mo (flat, up to 10 agents)
- **Target channels**: r/SaaS, r/startups, Indie Hackers, AppSumo

## Risks
1. Real-time messaging infrastructure is complex
2. Crisp already offers affordable option
3. Reliability is critical — downtime loses customer trust

## Next Steps
1. Build shared inbox + live chat widget MVP (3-4 weeks)
2. Add AI auto-reply based on knowledge base (2 weeks)
3. Position as "Intercom for bootstrapped startups"
4. AppSumo launch
