# AI Receptionist for Local Businesses — Score: 86/105

**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-23
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)

## Concept
Industry-specific AI receptionist pre-trained on trade vocabulary and workflows. Plumbing AI knows "my pipe burst" is emergency vs. "quote for bathroom remodel" is routine. Answers 24/7, triages calls, books into calendar, texts summary to owner. Replaces $240-750/mo human answering services at $49-79/mo.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Smith.ai ($240-750/mo), Ruby ($235-640/mo). Netic raised $43M. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Expensive. Generic, not trade-trained. Netic targets $20M+ revenue. |
| LTD Viability | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Ongoing API costs. Need "$199 LTD for X calls/mo" with limits. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Always paid. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Every trade subreddit discusses missed calls. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "AI answering service for plumbers." |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Usage costs limit model. |
| Review Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "Never miss a call" is measurable. |
| MRR Path | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | Per-call/per-minute is natural recurring. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Twilio + LLM + calendar API in 2-4 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Serves boring trades but AI is tech-adjacent. |

## Next Steps
1. Validate unit economics per call/minute
2. Build for ONE trade first (plumbing)
3. MVP: answer, triage, book, text summary
4. Test with 5 plumbing businesses

## Risks
1. LLM + telephony costs may kill LTD margins
2. Bad AI experience costs the business a customer
3. Netic ($43M funded) could expand downmarket
