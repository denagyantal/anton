# AI Receptionist for Trades — Score: 78/105

**Tier**: 1 (Strong Opportunity)
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Evaluation Date**: 2026-02-24

## Summary
AI-powered phone/text intake for trades businesses that miss 60-80% of calls. Auto-answer, qualify leads, book appointments, follow up. Risk: Jobber/HCP bundling AI receptionists as platform feature, and well-funded competitors (Elyos $13M, Netic $43M).

## Market Data
- **Funded Competitors**: Elyos AI ($13M Series A), Netic ($43M raised, $450M valuation)
- **Platform Risk**: Jobber AI Receptionist now built into platform
- **Opportunity**: Ultra-niche (dental insurance verification, plumbing emergency triage)
