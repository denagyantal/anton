# AI Receptionist for Local Service Businesses

**Score: 85/105** | **Verdict: BUILD** | **Priority: #8**

## Concept
Industry-specific AI phone agent pre-trained on trade terminology and workflows. Answers calls 24/7, triages emergency vs routine, books appointments, captures lead info, texts back with booking links. Start with one trade (plumbing) and expand. $49-79/mo instead of $300+/mo human services.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Smith.ai $240-750/mo, Ruby $235-640/mo. Netic raised $43M, 50K+ jobs booked. 60-80% of calls missed. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Human services $200-500/mo. Generic AI not trade-specific. Netic targets large operators. |
| LTD Viability | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Ongoing API costs. "$199 LTD + $0.10/call" or "$149 setup + $19/mo usage." |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | No free answering services. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Same trade channels plus dental, legal, salon. "Never miss a call" resonates universally. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "AI answering service for plumbers", "virtual receptionist small business". |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | High perceived value. Usage-limited LTD can work. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Measurable ROI (missed calls → booked jobs) drives reviews. |
| MRR Path | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | Usage-based pricing is natural recurring. Per-minute or per-call. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | 2-4 week MVP. Twilio/Vapi + LLM APIs + calendar integration. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Serves deeply boring businesses. Product itself is tech-adjacent. |

## Target Market
Solo plumbers, HVAC techs, electricians, dental offices, law firms, auto repair shops, salons — any local business that misses calls. Start with plumbing as beachhead.

## Key Differentiators
1. Trade-specific training (knows "my pipe burst" is emergency vs "quote for bathroom remodel" is routine)
2. $49-79/mo vs $300+/mo human services
3. 24/7 coverage including weekends and holidays
4. Spanish/English bilingual capability
5. Seamless handoff to human for complex calls

## LTD Pricing
- **Tier 1**: $199 (100 calls/month included, one trade, calendar integration)
- **Tier 2**: $399 (300 calls/month, multi-trade, CRM integration, custom scripts)

## Next Steps
1. MVP: AI phone agent for plumbing — answers calls, triages, books appointments, captures leads
2. Use Vapi/Bland.ai for voice + custom prompts trained on plumbing terminology
3. Test with 5-10 plumbing businesses
4. Expand to HVAC, dental, legal after validation

## Risks
1. API costs eat margins (mitigate: usage caps, per-call pricing for MRR)
2. Voice quality not perfect yet (mitigate: human handoff for complex calls)
3. Netic and well-funded competitors could dominate (mitigate: focus on solo operators they ignore)
