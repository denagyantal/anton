# Freelancer Client Onboarding Hub

**Evaluation Score**: 78/95 (Tier 1 — #2 Recommendation)
**Verdict**: BUILD

## One-Line Pitch
Beautiful client portal that collects documents, brand assets, and questionnaires with automated reminders — no more chasing clients over email.

## Problem
"Freelancers waste time chasing clients for documents." Every new project starts with a week of back-and-forth emails collecting brand assets, credentials, questionnaire responses, and contracts. No tool built specifically for the freelancer-to-client handoff.

## Evidence of Demand
- 70M+ freelancers globally
- Dubsado at $40/mo validates willingness to pay for onboarding tools
- Frequent posts in r/freelance and r/webdev about onboarding friction
- Multiple Reddit "I wish there was" posts about client document collection

## Competitors & Why They Fail
| Competitor | Price | Key Weakness |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Dubsado | $40/mo | Complex, overkill for simple onboarding |
| Notion | Free-$10/mo | Too generic, no client-facing portal |
| Google Forms | Free | Ugly, no file management, unprofessional |
| HoneyBook | $16-$66/mo | Broader focus, not onboarding-specific |

## Our Product
- **Client portal**: Branded page where clients upload everything in one place
- **Smart templates**: Pre-built onboarding flows for web designers, marketers, copywriters, photographers
- **Auto-reminders**: Nudge clients when items are missing
- **File management**: Organized by project, searchable
- **E-signatures**: Built-in contract signing
- **Status dashboard**: See at a glance which clients have completed onboarding

## Go-To-Market
- **LTD Price**: $69 (unlimited clients and projects)
- **MRR Price**: $29/mo after LTD phase
- **Target channels**: r/freelance, r/webdev, freelancer Facebook groups, Upwork/Fiverr communities
- **AppSumo potential**: YES — freelancer tools perform exceptionally well
- **First niche**: Web designers (clear workflow: collect brand guide, content, images, hosting access)

## MRR Path
LTD phase → agency tier (multi-user, $49/mo) → white-label option ($99/mo) → integrations with PM tools

## Team Fit
- **Front-end**: Client portal + dashboard (standard web app)
- **Back-end**: File storage, email reminders, e-signatures (straightforward)
- **Designer**: Beautiful, trustworthy client-facing portal UX
- **Generalist**: r/freelance community marketing, AppSumo launch

## Risks
1. Low switching cost — easy for competitors to copy
2. Template quality is the key differentiator (must be excellent)
3. Client adoption — clients need to actually use the portal

## Next Steps
1. Build client portal MVP with file upload + questionnaires (2 weeks)
2. Create 5 industry-specific templates (web design, marketing, photography, copywriting, consulting)
3. Beta test with 10 web designers from r/webdev
4. Launch on AppSumo with "stop chasing clients" messaging
