# HN & Indie Hackers Boring Business Scan — 2026-02-24

## InstaBuild — Construction Invoicing & Payment Reminders
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44246559
- **Additional Links**: https://instabuild.xyz
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Show HN
- **Engagement**: 1 upvote (low traction — early/undiscovered)
- **Revenue Data**: Pre-revenue; offering 1 year free to first 20 users
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Construction — small teams, independent contractors, subcontractors
- **Core Value Prop**: Rapid invoice generation, per-project time/material/cost tracking, automated payment reminders to reduce collection delays. Built for people "running jobs, managing subs, or juggling material costs."
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Very early stage with no traction on HN. Construction invoicing is a massive pain point — contractors lose significant revenue to late payments. Current tools (QuickBooks, FreshBooks) aren't built for construction workflows (progress billing, change orders, retainage). No integrations mentioned, no mobile-first approach visible.
- **Our Angle**: Build a construction-specific financial management tool with mobile-first design, progress billing, change order tracking, retainage management, and lien waiver generation. Integrate with accounting software. Offer LTD to lock in early adopters in a market with high willingness to pay.

## FleetFix — Free Trucking Fleet Management
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46468469
- **Additional Links**: https://fleetfix-begin.vercel.app/login
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Show HN
- **Engagement**: 2 upvotes, 1 comment (comment requested a landing page before signup)
- **Revenue Data**: Free tool, no revenue model visible
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Small/mid-size trucking fleets
- **Core Value Prop**: Vehicle management (VIN, plate, status tracking), maintenance logging with cost/mileage, parts inventory tracking, downtime analytics with uptime calculations, calendar view for scheduled maintenance, CSV export and printable logbooks.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Enterprise solutions (Fleetio, Samsara) are expensive and complex for small fleets (5-50 trucks). This is a free hobby project with no landing page and no revenue model — it validates the need but isn't a real business. The market wants simple, affordable fleet management without enterprise complexity. Comment feedback confirms friction: "show me features before I sign up."
- **Our Angle**: Build a purpose-built fleet management tool for small trucking operations ($29-99/mo) with mobile-first driver app, maintenance scheduling with push notifications, DOT compliance tracking, fuel cost analytics, and simple onboarding. Fleet owners are not tech-savvy — UX simplicity wins. LTD model would resonate with owner-operators.

## QuotationGenie — Quotes, Invoices & Contracts Dashboard
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44860722
- **Additional Links**: https://www.quotationgenie.online
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Show HN
- **Engagement**: 2 upvotes, 2 comments (negative — broken domain link issue)
- **Revenue Data**: None available
- **Boring Business Score**: 3
- **Target Industry**: Small business owners and freelancers (general)
- **Core Value Prop**: Create customized quotations, generate invoices with payment status tracking (paid/unpaid/overdue), draft/send/sign contracts digitally — unified dashboard.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Execution problems (broken domain, poor launch). The concept of unifying quotes → invoices → contracts is solid but generic. Market is crowded for general freelancer tools. Could be powerful if niched down to a specific trade (e.g., "QuotationGenie for HVAC contractors" with industry-specific templates, materials databases, labor rate calculators).
- **Our Angle**: Take the quote-to-invoice-to-contract pipeline and build it specifically for a boring industry vertical. Include material cost databases, labor calculators, industry-standard contract templates, and photo documentation. Trades businesses hate generic tools that don't understand their workflow.
- **LTD Potential**: 3

## Onigiri — Simple Invoicing for Freelancers & Contractors
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40220699
- **Additional Links**: https://onigiri.one
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Show HN
- **Engagement**: 113 upvotes, 72 comments (strong engagement)
- **Revenue Data**: $9/month subscription, 14-day free trial
- **Boring Business Score**: 2
- **Target Industry**: Freelancers and contractors (general/tech-leaning)
- **Core Value Prop**: Streamlined invoicing — create, send, and store invoices with minimal complexity. Built on Framer.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: High HN engagement proves demand for simpler invoicing. Key feedback: users wanted freemium not trial, missing time tracking, no QuickBooks/Xero integration, privacy policy concerns. Competitive landscape is brutal (Invoice Ninja, Zoho, Harvest, Bonsai). General freelancer invoicing is a red ocean.
- **Our Angle**: The 113 upvotes validate that "stupidly simple invoicing" resonates. But the opportunity is to vertical-ize this for a boring niche — invoicing for plumbers/HVAC/electricians with flat-rate pricing books, service agreement templates, warranty tracking, and parts markup calculators. Blue ocean in trades invoicing vs. red ocean in freelancer invoicing.
- **LTD Potential**: 3

## Stagetimer — Live Event Timer SaaS ($15k+ MRR)
- **Source**: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/tech/turning-a-simple-b2b-solution-into-a-15k-mrr-saas-by-exploiting-a-market-niche-xIxrVwn24DVsN8b3PYD3
- **Additional Links**: https://stagetimer.io (implied)
- **Platform**: Indie Hackers
- **Type**: Revenue milestone / Interview
- **Engagement**: Featured post on IH
- **Revenue Data**: $15k MRR (subscriptions) + ~$5k from one-time purchases = ~$20k/mo total. Hybrid subscription + one-time pricing.
- **Boring Business Score**: 4
- **Target Industry**: Live events, video production, broadcast — multi-person teams needing synchronized timing across screens
- **Core Value Prop**: Remote-controlled countdown timers for live events and video production. Synchronized timing across multiple screens for event crews.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Founder validated via Reddit, discovered broader market of multi-person event teams. SEO dominance in low-volume, high-intent keywords with almost no competition. Hybrid pricing (subscription + one-time) matched customer behavior better than pure SaaS. The lesson: find a niche where you can own SEO for every relevant keyword.
- **Our Angle**: The playbook here is replicable: find a boring B2B operational tool used by small teams in non-tech industries, nail SEO for niche keywords, offer hybrid pricing. Adjacent opportunities: backstage crew management, event equipment tracking, venue booking/scheduling tools.
- **LTD Potential**: 3

## Rashid Khasanov's SaaS Portfolio ($42k MRR) — "Boring Problems Have Strong Moats"
- **Source**: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/tech/after-burning-through-his-savings-and-going-into-debt-this-founder-built-a-42k-mrr-portfolio-FGEm1BtZPZV9lqW4QptN
- **Additional Links**: https://angelmatch.io, https://investorhunt.co, https://journalisthunt.co
- **Platform**: Indie Hackers
- **Type**: Revenue milestone
- **Engagement**: Featured post on IH
- **Revenue Data**: Angel Match $37.3k MRR, Investor Hunt $4.6k MRR, Journalist Hunt $180 MRR, Autoposts $491 MRR. Total: $42.5k MRR.
- **Boring Business Score**: 2 (startup/VC adjacent, not truly boring industry)
- **Target Industry**: Startup fundraising, PR/media outreach
- **Core Value Prop**: Curated databases replacing manual spreadsheet research. Angel Match = find investors; Investor Hunt = investor database; Journalist Hunt = PR contacts.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Key insight: "Boring problems have strong moats" — curated databases are harder to kill than AI wrappers. Strategy: identify workflows currently solved with spreadsheets, validate willingness to pay, compound via SEO. The database/directory model is highly replicable for boring industries.
- **Our Angle**: Apply the curated database model to boring industries: contractor databases for property managers, supplier directories for restaurants, licensed tradesperson directories for homeowners, equipment rental directories for construction. These are spreadsheet-replacement opportunities in industries with zero tech competition.
- **LTD Potential**: 4

## Industry-Specific CRM/PM Tool ($10k/mo, 34 Customers)
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37501485 (comment in "One-person SaaS" thread)
- **Additional Links**: None (anonymous commenter)
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Ask HN discussion comment
- **Engagement**: Parent thread: major engagement (Ask HN classic)
- **Revenue Data**: ~$10k/month, 34 paying companies (~300 employees), runs on $4/mo server
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Unspecified industry (built with father's domain expertise)
- **Core Value Prop**: Industry-specific CRM and project management. PHP/jQuery stack. Ultra-low costs ($4/mo hosting) = near-100% margins.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: This is the boring business archetype: a one-person SaaS built with deep domain knowledge of a specific industry, using simple tech, making $10k/mo with 34 customers. The father provided the industry expertise — the dev provided the code. This model is replicated across thousands of niches but rarely discussed because founders don't hang out on HN.
- **Our Angle**: Partner with domain experts in boring industries (or deeply research one) and build hyper-specific CRM/PM tools. The tech is trivial — the moat is understanding the industry workflow. Target: any industry where people still use Excel + email + paper for project/client management.
- **LTD Potential**: 5

## GorillaDesk — Field Service Software (Pest, Lawn, Cleaning)
- **Source**: https://gorilladesk.com/
- **Additional Links**: https://gorilladesk.com/industries/
- **Platform**: Market research (competitor analysis)
- **Type**: Established competitor in boring niche
- **Engagement**: 2,000+ business customers, 12+ years in market (founded 2013)
- **Revenue Data**: Not public. Pricing starts at ~$49/mo per route. Serves pest control, lawn care, pool service, cleaning.
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Field service — pest control, lawn care, pool service, cleaning businesses
- **Core Value Prop**: All-in-one: scheduling, dispatching, CRM, invoicing, estimating, route optimization, mobile app for field crews.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: GorillaDesk has been around 12+ years — proves the market is real and large. But competitors in this space (Jobber, ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro) are raising prices and moving upmarket. Opening exists for an affordable, modern alternative targeting the smallest operators (solo + 1-5 employees) who find existing tools bloated and expensive. The "DIY plumber who just wants to send invoices from his truck" is underserved.
- **Our Angle**: Build a dead-simple, mobile-first field service tool for solo operators and micro-businesses (1-5 people). Focus on the 3 things they actually need: scheduling, invoicing, and customer communication. Price aggressively ($19-39/mo). LTD model would destroy in this market — field service operators love one-time purchases.
- **LTD Potential**: 5

## "Why Boring Businesses Outlast AI Hype Cycles" — Market Signal
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44848018
- **Additional Links**: None
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Discussion / trend article
- **Engagement**: 4 upvotes, 3 comments
- **Revenue Data**: Mentions government forms software company doing $30M/year annual revenue
- **Boring Business Score**: 5 (meta — about the boring business thesis)
- **Target Industry**: Cross-industry thesis
- **Core Value Prop**: Article argues boring businesses beat AI hype due to: reduced competition, sticky customers, predictable revenue, lower CAC. Specific example: government assistance forms software = $30M ARR.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Four strategies for finding opportunities: (1) personal daily frustrations, (2) survey networks about workplace inefficiencies, (3) identify lingering manual processes (spreadsheets, faxing), (4) monitor complaint threads on Reddit/Twitter/industry forums. The government forms angle ($30M ARR!) suggests massive untapped opportunities in compliance, permitting, licensing, and paperwork automation for boring industries.
- **Our Angle**: Government/compliance paperwork automation for specific trades: contractor licensing applications, building permit submissions, insurance certificate management, safety compliance documentation. Every tradesperson hates paperwork — most still do it on paper or basic PDFs.
- **LTD Potential**: 4

## "SaaS System of Record Is Cooked" — Vertical SaaS Opportunity Signal
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46917886
- **Additional Links**: None
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Tell HN discussion
- **Engagement**: 103 upvotes, 46 comments (strong signal)
- **Revenue Data**: None directly, but discusses enterprise SaaS margin compression
- **Boring Business Score**: 3 (meta-discussion about SaaS landscape)
- **Target Industry**: Enterprise SaaS landscape analysis
- **Core Value Prop**: Senior PM (20 years experience) argues large system-of-record SaaS companies are threatened by AI agents, open-source alternatives (Cal.com, Twenty CRM), and value migration to "agent layer" and "data layer."
- **Gap/Opportunity**: As enterprise SaaS gets disrupted from above (AI) and below (open-source), the opportunity shifts to vertical-specific tools where domain knowledge matters more than generic features. Open-source + AI makes it cheaper than ever to build SaaS — the differentiator becomes industry expertise. Thread confirms: small, focused, vertical tools with real domain knowledge will win vs. bloated horizontal platforms.
- **Our Angle**: Use open-source foundations (Cal.com for scheduling, Twenty for CRM) and add vertical-specific features for boring industries. Ship faster, charge less, win on domain understanding. The tech moat is dead — the domain moat is everything.
- **LTD Potential**: 3

## Liinks — Link-in-Bio Tool ($25k MRR by Undercutting)
- **Source**: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/tech/solo-founder-carved-a-25k-mo-niche-out-of-a-saturated-market-by-undercutting-the-competition-rRxyYFmG95zcSKSYdtM8
- **Additional Links**: https://liinks.co (implied)
- **Platform**: Indie Hackers
- **Type**: Revenue milestone / Interview
- **Engagement**: Featured post on IH
- **Revenue Data**: $25k MRR. Premium $4/mo, Pro $10/mo. ~$100 LTV per customer. 4.5 years to reach milestone.
- **Boring Business Score**: 1 (creator economy, not boring industry)
- **Target Industry**: Social media creators (link-in-bio)
- **Core Value Prop**: Cleaner, cheaper Linktree alternative. Undercut on price, win on UX simplicity. Removed free tier to reduce abuse.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Not a boring business itself, but the playbook is highly relevant: enter a saturated market, undercut aggressively on price (enabled by lean solo operations), win on UX simplicity, remove the free tier. This exact strategy works for boring industries — most trades software is overpriced and bloated.
- **Our Angle**: Apply the "undercut and simplify" playbook to an existing boring-industry vertical SaaS. Find the GorillaDesk/Jobber/ServiceTitan of a specific trade, build 80% of the features at 30% of the price, with 10x better onboarding.
- **LTD Potential**: 2

- **Additional Links**: https://storyshort.ai, https://capacity.so, https://useartemis.co
- **Platform**: Indie Hackers
- **Type**: Revenue milestone / Interview
- **Engagement**: Featured post on IH
- **Revenue Data**: StoryShort.ai ~$20k/mo, UseArtemis.co ~$5k/mo, Capacity.so ~$3k/mo. Total $28k/mo.
- **Boring Business Score**: 1 (AI/content tools, not boring)
- **Target Industry**: Content marketing, LinkedIn automation, no-code building
- **Core Value Prop**: Portfolio approach — multiple products, same tech stack (Next.js, Node, MongoDB, Vercel+AWS), SEO + paid ads for distribution.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Not boring businesses, but the portfolio strategy is relevant: use identical tech stack across products, validate with search volume/SEO metrics/competitor analysis before building, rely on SEO for compounding growth. Apply this to boring verticals.
- **Our Angle**: Build a portfolio of 3-5 boring-industry micro-SaaS tools using the same tech stack. Each targets a different trade vertical. Cross-sell between them. Use SEO to own niche keywords in each vertical.
- **LTD Potential**: 2

# Key Themes & Patterns

## Highest-Signal Opportunities

1. **Construction/Trades Invoicing & Financial Management** (InstaBuild, Onigiri demand signal): Massive pain point, contractors lose revenue to late payments, existing tools don't understand construction workflows. Boring Business Score: 5. LTD Potential: 4-5.

2. **Micro Fleet Management for Owner-Operators** (FleetFix signal): Small trucking/delivery fleets (5-50 vehicles) are underserved. Enterprise tools too expensive, free tools too basic. Boring Business Score: 5. LTD Potential: 4.

3. **Field Service Tool for Solo/Micro Operators** (GorillaDesk gap): The 1-5 person pest control/lawn/cleaning business that finds Jobber/GorillaDesk too expensive and complex. Mobile-first, dead simple, $19-39/mo. Boring Business Score: 5. LTD Potential: 5.

4. **Curated Directories for Boring Industries** (Khasanov model): Apply the database/directory model to trades — contractor directories, supplier databases, equipment rental directories. Replace spreadsheets. Boring Business Score: 4. LTD Potential: 4.

5. **Compliance/Paperwork Automation for Trades** (Government forms $30M signal): Licensing, permitting, insurance certificates, safety documentation. Every tradesperson hates paperwork. Boring Business Score: 5. LTD Potential: 4.

## Recurring Patterns

- **"Boring problems have strong moats"** — curated databases, operational tools, and industry-specific workflows are harder to replicate than AI wrappers
- **SEO dominance in niche keywords** is the #1 growth channel for boring-business SaaS (Stagetimer, Khasanov portfolio)
- **Hybrid pricing** (subscription + one-time) outperforms pure SaaS in markets where customers buy infrequently (events, construction projects)
- **Domain expertise > tech sophistication** — the $10k/mo industry CRM runs on PHP/jQuery and a $4/mo server; the moat is understanding the workflow
- **Enterprise SaaS disruption creates space below** — as ServiceTitan/Jobber move upmarket, micro-operators get left behind
- **The "undercut and simplify" playbook** works: enter a market with expensive, bloated incumbents, build 80% of features at 30% of the price
