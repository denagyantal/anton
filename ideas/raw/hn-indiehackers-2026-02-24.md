## Craftplan — Open-Source Production Management for Small Manufacturers
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46847690
- **Additional Links**: https://elixirforum.com/t/craftplan-open-source-production-management-for-small-manufacturers/74142, https://github.com (repo linked in HN post)
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Show HN
- **Engagement**: 577 upvotes, 167 comments (massive engagement — top Show HN)
- **Revenue Data**: Open-source, no revenue model yet. Competitors charge $10k-$50k/year (enterprise ERPs) or $200-500/mo (mid-market like Sage100, Craftybase)
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Small-batch manufacturers — bakeries, soap makers, breweries, candle makers, biscotti producers, 3D print shops, any artisanal/small-scale manufacturer
- **Core Value Prop**: Recipe management (versioned BOMs with cost rollups), inventory tracking (lot traceability, allergen tracking, demand forecasting), production batch planning, order management, purchasing. Built with Elixir/Phoenix LiveView. Developer built it in "a few weeks" for his wife's micro-bakery.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: 577 upvotes proves massive demand. Comment thread reveals parallel needs across bakeries, soap makers, breweries, 3D printing, restaurants — all currently using spreadsheets. Enterprise ERPs are $10k-50k/year and wildly overcomplex. Mid-market tools (Craftybase at ~$50/mo) exist but are limited. The "small-batch manufacturer who outgrew spreadsheets but can't afford ERP" is a huge underserved segment. Open-source approach means no recurring revenue — commercial opportunity to build a hosted/managed version.
- **Our Angle**: Build a hosted, managed version of production management for small manufacturers. Price at $39-99/mo (10x cheaper than mid-market, 100x cheaper than enterprise). Focus on the onboarding experience — these users aren't technical. Add e-commerce integrations (Shopify, Etsy, Square) since most small manufacturers sell online. Vertical-specific templates (bakery vs. soap vs. brewery have different workflows). LTD would absolutely crush in this market — small manufacturers love one-time purchases.
- **LTD Potential**: 5

## Onedesk — Commercial Cleaning SaaS ($100k+ MRR)
- **Source**: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/2020-in-review-0-to-100k-mrr-for-our-cleaning-saas-ecommerce-d53de6dde5
- **Additional Links**: https://onedesk.com (implied)
- **Platform**: Indie Hackers
- **Type**: Revenue milestone
- **Engagement**: Featured post on IH
- **Revenue Data**: $100k+ MRR reached within 10 months of launch (March 2020). Revenue split between SaaS cleaning services platform and ecommerce (cleaning equipment like electrostatic sprayers).
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Commercial cleaning — offices, retail stores, restaurants, malls
- **Core Value Prop**: Platform for booking commercial cleaning services. Mobile app for office managers to do self-guided walkthroughs (no in-person visits needed). Web app for messaging cleaners, paying invoices, scheduling services. Also sells cleaning equipment via ecommerce.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: $100B+ commercial cleaning industry. Onedesk proved the model works — SaaS + marketplace + ecommerce for a boring industry. Growth came from SEO + PR/content marketing (positioned as disinfection experts during COVID). Key insight: "distribution is everything." The hybrid SaaS + ecommerce model generated higher ARPU than pure SaaS. The cleaning industry is still massively fragmented with thousands of small operators using no software.
- **Our Angle**: Build a modern cleaning business management platform (not marketplace) — scheduling, dispatching, quality inspections, customer communication, invoicing. Target the cleaning company operator, not the office manager. Include mobile app for cleaning crews (clock-in/out, checklist completion, photo documentation). Pair with supply ordering to capture ecommerce revenue. LTD for the SaaS component would attract cost-conscious cleaning business owners.
- **LTD Potential**: 5

## InstaBuild — Construction Invoicing & Payment Reminders
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44246559
- **Additional Links**: https://instabuild.xyz
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Show HN
- **Engagement**: 1 upvote (low traction — early/undiscovered)
- **Revenue Data**: Pre-revenue; offering 1 year free to first 20 users
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Construction — small teams, independent contractors, subcontractors
- **Core Value Prop**: Rapid invoice generation, per-project time/material/cost tracking, automated payment reminders to reduce collection delays. Built for people "running jobs, managing subs, or juggling material costs."
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Very early stage with no traction on HN. Construction invoicing is a massive pain point — contractors lose significant revenue to late payments. Current tools (QuickBooks, FreshBooks) aren't built for construction workflows (progress billing, change orders, retainage). No integrations mentioned, no mobile-first approach visible.
- **Our Angle**: Build a construction-specific financial management tool with mobile-first design, progress billing, change order tracking, retainage management, and lien waiver generation. Integrate with accounting software. Offer LTD to lock in early adopters in a market with high willingness to pay.
- **LTD Potential**: 4

## FleetFix — Free Trucking Fleet Management
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46468469
- **Additional Links**: https://fleetfix-begin.vercel.app/login
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Show HN
- **Engagement**: 2 upvotes, 1 comment (comment requested a landing page before signup)
- **Revenue Data**: Free tool, no revenue model visible
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Small/mid-size trucking fleets
- **Core Value Prop**: Vehicle management (VIN, plate, status tracking), maintenance logging with cost/mileage, parts inventory tracking, downtime analytics with uptime calculations, calendar view for scheduled maintenance, CSV export and printable logbooks.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Enterprise solutions (Fleetio, Samsara) are expensive and complex for small fleets (5-50 trucks). This is a free hobby project with no landing page and no revenue model — it validates the need but isn't a real business. The market wants simple, affordable fleet management without enterprise complexity. Comment feedback confirms friction: "show me features before I sign up."
- **Our Angle**: Build a purpose-built fleet management tool for small trucking operations ($29-99/mo) with mobile-first driver app, maintenance scheduling with push notifications, DOT compliance tracking, fuel cost analytics, and simple onboarding. Fleet owners are not tech-savvy — UX simplicity wins. LTD model would resonate with owner-operators.
- **LTD Potential**: 4

## NicheNav Concept — Locksmith CRM & Dispatch
- **Source**: https://www.flowjam.com/blog/indie-hackers-saas-ideas-2025-10-you-can-launch-fast
- **Additional Links**: None (concept, not launched product)
- **Platform**: Indie Hackers / Blog
- **Type**: Validated idea / Market analysis
- **Engagement**: N/A (concept article)
- **Revenue Data**: Proposed $49/user/month. Target market: 25,000+ mom-and-pop locksmiths in North America.
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Locksmith services
- **Core Value Prop**: Job dispatch with SMS ETA, key-code lookup tables, invoice auto-sending to property managers. Generic CRMs don't track "key-code" fields or handle 24/7 dispatch needs.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: 25k+ locksmith businesses, most using paper/phone/generic tools. Locksmiths need: 24/7 dispatch (emergency lockouts), key-code databases, property manager invoicing, mobile-first (always in the field). No purpose-built SaaS exists for this niche. At $49/user/mo, capturing 5% = $61k MRR.
- **Our Angle**: Build a locksmith-specific dispatch + CRM tool. The key differentiator is the key-code database integration and 24/7 emergency dispatch workflow. Expand to adjacent trades (mobile auto repair, emergency plumbing, towing). LTD would resonate — locksmiths are solo operators who hate subscriptions.
- **LTD Potential**: 5

## MedMemo Concept — Therapist Voice Notes to SOAP Notes
- **Source**: https://www.flowjam.com/blog/indie-hackers-saas-ideas-2025-10-you-can-launch-fast
- **Additional Links**: None (concept, not launched product)
- **Platform**: Indie Hackers / Blog
- **Type**: Validated idea / Market analysis
- **Engagement**: N/A (concept article)
- **Revenue Data**: Proposed $59/month solo, $199/month group practice. Target market: 400,000 licensed mental health counselors in US.
- **Boring Business Score**: 4
- **Target Industry**: Mental health / Therapy practices
- **Core Value Prop**: Voice memo recording after sessions → AI-drafted SOAP notes → encrypted EHR export. HIPAA-compliant. Therapists spend 30+ minutes nightly on session notes.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: 400k therapists in the US, most doing notes manually or with generic EHR tools not designed for the therapy workflow. The voice-to-SOAP-note pipeline is a massive time-saver. HIPAA compliance is a hard requirement that keeps casual competitors out. At $59/mo, capturing 1% = $236k MRR.
- **Our Angle**: The AI transcription + SOAP note generation is technically straightforward with current LLMs. The moat is HIPAA compliance, EHR integration, and trust. Build for solo therapists first (simpler compliance), expand to group practices. Partner with therapy associations for distribution. LTD works here — therapists are often solo practitioners who prefer one-time costs.
- **LTD Potential**: 4

## SwiftGrant Concept — Municipal Grant Writer
- **Source**: https://www.flowjam.com/blog/indie-hackers-saas-ideas-2025-10-you-can-launch-fast
- **Additional Links**: None (concept, not launched product)
- **Platform**: Indie Hackers / Blog
- **Type**: Validated idea / Market analysis
- **Engagement**: N/A (concept article)
- **Revenue Data**: Proposed $2,000/grant (success-based) or $499/month subscription. Target market: 19,000 US municipalities under 100k population.
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Local government / Municipalities
- **Core Value Prop**: Q&A wizard for federal grant application forms, compliance checklists, collaboration tools. Cities leave $3 billion in federal funding unclaimed annually due to grant-writing friction.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: $3B left on the table annually. 19k municipalities, most without dedicated grant writers. Success-based pricing ($2k/grant) is extremely attractive to cash-strapped small cities — they only pay if they win. The regulatory/compliance angle creates a natural moat. Government contracts are sticky with high switching costs.
- **Our Angle**: Build a grant-writing assistant for small municipalities. The success-based model is genius — aligns incentives perfectly. Start with the most common/simple federal grants (CDBG, USDA Rural Development), expand to state grants. Distribution: attend municipal association conferences, partner with state municipal leagues. LTD doesn't fit here — success-based or subscription is better.
- **LTD Potential**: 2

## QuotationGenie — Quotes, Invoices & Contracts Dashboard
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44860722
- **Additional Links**: https://www.quotationgenie.online
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Show HN
- **Engagement**: 2 upvotes, 2 comments (negative — broken domain link issue)
- **Revenue Data**: None available
- **Boring Business Score**: 3
- **Target Industry**: Small business owners and freelancers (general)
- **Core Value Prop**: Create customized quotations, generate invoices with payment status tracking (paid/unpaid/overdue), draft/send/sign contracts digitally — unified dashboard.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Execution problems (broken domain, poor launch). The concept of unifying quotes → invoices → contracts is solid but generic. Market is crowded for general freelancer tools. Could be powerful if niched down to a specific trade (e.g., "QuotationGenie for HVAC contractors" with industry-specific templates, materials databases, labor rate calculators).
- **Our Angle**: Take the quote-to-invoice-to-contract pipeline and build it specifically for a boring industry vertical. Include material cost databases, labor calculators, industry-standard contract templates, and photo documentation. Trades businesses hate generic tools that don't understand their workflow.
- **LTD Potential**: 3

## Onigiri — Simple Invoicing for Freelancers & Contractors
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40220699
- **Additional Links**: https://onigiri.one
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Show HN
- **Engagement**: 113 upvotes, 72 comments (strong engagement)
- **Revenue Data**: $9/month subscription, 14-day free trial
- **Boring Business Score**: 2
- **Target Industry**: Freelancers and contractors (general/tech-leaning)
- **Core Value Prop**: Streamlined invoicing — create, send, and store invoices with minimal complexity. Built on Framer.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: High HN engagement proves demand for simpler invoicing. Key feedback: users wanted freemium not trial, missing time tracking, no QuickBooks/Xero integration, privacy policy concerns. Competitive landscape is brutal (Invoice Ninja, Zoho, Harvest, Bonsai). General freelancer invoicing is a red ocean.
- **Our Angle**: The 113 upvotes validate that "stupidly simple invoicing" resonates. But the opportunity is to vertical-ize this for a boring niche — invoicing for plumbers/HVAC/electricians with flat-rate pricing books, service agreement templates, warranty tracking, and parts markup calculators. Blue ocean in trades invoicing vs. red ocean in freelancer invoicing.
- **LTD Potential**: 3

## Stagetimer — Live Event Timer SaaS ($15k+ MRR)
- **Source**: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/tech/turning-a-simple-b2b-solution-into-a-15k-mrr-saas-by-exploiting-a-market-niche-xIxrVwn24DVsN8b3PYD3
- **Additional Links**: https://stagetimer.io (implied)
- **Platform**: Indie Hackers
- **Type**: Revenue milestone / Interview
- **Engagement**: Featured post on IH
- **Revenue Data**: $15k MRR (subscriptions) + ~$5k from one-time purchases = ~$20k/mo total. Hybrid subscription + one-time pricing. Secondary product Rundown Studio at $4k MRR.
- **Boring Business Score**: 4
- **Target Industry**: Live events, video production, broadcast — multi-person teams needing synchronized timing across screens
- **Core Value Prop**: Remote-controlled countdown timers for live events and video production. Synchronized timing across multiple screens for event crews.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Founder validated via Reddit, discovered broader market of multi-person event teams. SEO dominance in low-volume, high-intent keywords with almost no competition. Hybrid pricing (subscription + one-time) matched customer behavior better than pure SaaS. Key quote: "Amazing hardware with awful software...written in 1999" — the entire production/AV industry has terrible software. Founder's next targets: hydrogen cells, heat pumps, defense tech.
- **Our Angle**: The playbook here is replicable: find a boring B2B operational tool used by small teams in non-tech industries, nail SEO for niche keywords, offer hybrid pricing. Adjacent opportunities: backstage crew management, event equipment tracking, venue booking/scheduling tools. Also: explore AV/production industry broadly — "amazing hardware with awful software" = opportunity.
- **LTD Potential**: 3

## Rashid Khasanov's SaaS Portfolio ($42k MRR) — "Boring Problems Have Strong Moats"
- **Source**: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/tech/after-burning-through-his-savings-and-going-into-debt-this-founder-built-a-42k-mrr-portfolio-FGEm1BtZPZV9lqW4QptN
- **Additional Links**: https://angelmatch.io, https://investorhunt.co, https://journalisthunt.co
- **Platform**: Indie Hackers
- **Type**: Revenue milestone
- **Engagement**: Featured post on IH
- **Revenue Data**: Angel Match $37.3k MRR, Investor Hunt $4.6k MRR, Journalist Hunt $180 MRR, Autoposts $491 MRR. Total: $42.5k MRR.
- **Boring Business Score**: 2 (startup/VC adjacent, not truly boring industry)
- **Target Industry**: Startup fundraising, PR/media outreach
- **Core Value Prop**: Curated databases replacing manual spreadsheet research. Angel Match = find investors; Investor Hunt = investor database; Journalist Hunt = PR contacts.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Key insight: "Boring problems have strong moats" — curated databases are harder to kill than AI wrappers. Strategy: identify workflows currently solved with spreadsheets, validate willingness to pay, compound via SEO. The database/directory model is highly replicable for boring industries. Growth unlocked by hiring in-house SEO expert after stalling at $5k MRR.
- **Our Angle**: Apply the curated database model to boring industries: contractor databases for property managers, supplier directories for restaurants, licensed tradesperson directories for homeowners, equipment rental directories for construction. These are spreadsheet-replacement opportunities in industries with zero tech competition.
- **LTD Potential**: 4

## Industry-Specific CRM/PM Tool ($10k/mo, 34 Customers)
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37501485 (comment in "One-person SaaS" thread)
- **Additional Links**: None (anonymous commenter)
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Ask HN discussion comment
- **Engagement**: Parent thread: major engagement (Ask HN classic)
- **Revenue Data**: ~$10k/month, 34 paying companies (~300 employees), runs on $4/mo server
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Unspecified industry (built with father's domain expertise)
- **Core Value Prop**: Industry-specific CRM and project management. PHP/jQuery stack. Ultra-low costs ($4/mo hosting) = near-100% margins.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: This is the boring business archetype: a one-person SaaS built with deep domain knowledge of a specific industry, using simple tech, making $10k/mo with 34 customers. The father provided the industry expertise — the dev provided the code. This model is replicated across thousands of niches but rarely discussed because founders don't hang out on HN.
- **Our Angle**: Partner with domain experts in boring industries (or deeply research one) and build hyper-specific CRM/PM tools. The tech is trivial — the moat is understanding the industry workflow. Target: any industry where people still use Excel + email + paper for project/client management.
- **LTD Potential**: 5

## PerfectWiki — Microsoft Teams Knowledge Base ($200k ARR)
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37501485 (comment in "One-person SaaS" thread)
- **Additional Links**: https://perfectwiki.com
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Ask HN discussion comment
- **Engagement**: Parent thread: major engagement
- **Revenue Data**: $200k ARR, solo founder, 3 years, organic growth only
- **Boring Business Score**: 3
- **Target Industry**: Microsoft Teams-centric organizations (enterprise-adjacent)
- **Core Value Prop**: Knowledge base integrated directly into Microsoft Teams — wiki functionality where teams already work.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: $200k ARR as a solo founder with organic growth only. The lesson: build where the distribution already exists (Microsoft Teams marketplace). Teams has 320M+ monthly active users. Internal knowledge management is a "boring" problem every organization has. The Microsoft ecosystem has less competition than Slack/Notion ecosystem.
- **Our Angle**: Build boring internal tools for the Microsoft Teams marketplace targeting specific industries. Example: a Teams-integrated maintenance request tracker for property management companies, or a Teams-based dispatch board for field service companies. The distribution channel (Teams marketplace) reduces CAC to near-zero.
- **LTD Potential**: 3

## JustFax Online — Online Fax Service (€500+/mo)
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46307973 (comment in "$500/mo side projects" thread)
- **Additional Links**: https://justfaxonline.com
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Ask HN discussion comment
- **Engagement**: Parent thread: strong engagement
- **Revenue Data**: €500+/month consistently. One-time payment model. 100% SEO-driven.
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Healthcare, legal, government, real estate — industries that still use fax
- **Core Value Prop**: Online fax transmission. Send faxes from a web browser.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Fax is "dead" in tech but very alive in healthcare (HIPAA), legal, government, and real estate. The market is boring and stable — no VC competition, steady demand, high-intent SEO traffic. One-time payment model works because usage is intermittent. The product is trivially simple but serves a real need.
- **Our Angle**: The broader lesson: look for "dead" technologies that boring industries still require. HIPAA-compliant faxing, EDI transactions, legacy format conversions. These are ugly, unglamorous products with zero competition and steady revenue. Could bundle fax with other "legacy" communication tools boring industries need (voicemail transcription, SMS appointment reminders, automated phone trees).
- **LTD Potential**: 4

## GorillaDesk — Field Service Software (Pest, Lawn, Cleaning)
- **Source**: https://gorilladesk.com/
- **Additional Links**: https://gorilladesk.com/industries/
- **Platform**: Market research (competitor analysis)
- **Type**: Established competitor in boring niche
- **Engagement**: 2,000+ business customers, 12+ years in market (founded 2013)
- **Revenue Data**: Not public. Pricing starts at ~$49/mo per route. Serves pest control, lawn care, pool service, cleaning.
- **Boring Business Score**: 5
- **Target Industry**: Field service — pest control, lawn care, pool service, cleaning businesses
- **Core Value Prop**: All-in-one: scheduling, dispatching, CRM, invoicing, estimating, route optimization, mobile app for field crews.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: GorillaDesk has been around 12+ years — proves the market is real and large. But competitors in this space (Jobber, ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro) are raising prices and moving upmarket. Opening exists for an affordable, modern alternative targeting the smallest operators (solo + 1-5 employees) who find existing tools bloated and expensive. The "DIY plumber who just wants to send invoices from his truck" is underserved.
- **Our Angle**: Build a dead-simple, mobile-first field service tool for solo operators and micro-businesses (1-5 people). Focus on the 3 things they actually need: scheduling, invoicing, and customer communication. Price aggressively ($19-39/mo). LTD model would destroy in this market — field service operators love one-time purchases.
- **LTD Potential**: 5

## "Why Boring Businesses Outlast AI Hype Cycles" — Market Signal
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44848018
- **Additional Links**: None
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Discussion / trend article
- **Engagement**: 4 upvotes, 3 comments
- **Revenue Data**: Mentions government forms software company doing $30M/year annual revenue
- **Boring Business Score**: 5 (meta — about the boring business thesis)
- **Target Industry**: Cross-industry thesis
- **Core Value Prop**: Article argues boring businesses beat AI hype due to: reduced competition, sticky customers, predictable revenue, lower CAC. Specific example: government assistance forms software = $30M ARR.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Four strategies for finding opportunities: (1) personal daily frustrations, (2) survey networks about workplace inefficiencies, (3) identify lingering manual processes (spreadsheets, faxing), (4) monitor complaint threads on Reddit/Twitter/industry forums. The government forms angle ($30M ARR!) suggests massive untapped opportunities in compliance, permitting, licensing, and paperwork automation for boring industries.
- **Our Angle**: Government/compliance paperwork automation for specific trades: contractor licensing applications, building permit submissions, insurance certificate management, safety compliance documentation. Every tradesperson hates paperwork — most still do it on paper or basic PDFs.
- **LTD Potential**: 4

## HN Demand Signal: Industries Underserved by Software
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22496129
- **Additional Links**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35987740
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Ask HN (major thread, 200+ comments)
- **Engagement**: High engagement across multiple threads
- **Revenue Data**: Various data points from comments (see below)
- **Boring Business Score**: 5 (demand signals across multiple boring industries)
- **Target Industry**: Multiple (see list below)
- **Core Value Prop**: Direct demand signals from people working in underserved industries.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Key industries identified as underserved:
  - **Construction**: Natural stone distribution needs 5-7 software tools that don't exist well. Temporary labor tracking still uses carbon copies. Procore is emerging but expensive. Residential remodeling has zero good visualization tools.
  - **Agriculture/Farming**: Farmers are "spreadsheet jockeys" who understand tax law favoring capex over SaaS subscriptions — pricing model must adapt.
  - **Healthcare**: "18% of GDP" still running on "reams of paperwork...scanned and sent to each other." EHR interoperability is a nightmare.
  - **Legal**: Solo/small firm practitioners underserved. Clio found success here. Customers will "threaten lawsuits" — unique risk.
  - **Law enforcement**: Running on "monolith CRUD .NET client" from the late 80s/early 90s. Web/mobile considered "wizards of dark magic."
  - **Manufactured housing dealerships**: Mom-and-pop dealerships lost software vendors during 2000s contraction. Only recent SaaS entrant.
  - **Government/RFP process**: Still exchanging "RFP version 2 version C version 3.xlsx" via email.
  - **Scientific equipment**: Manufacturers have "little incentive to innovate" — proprietary formats, terrible UX.
  - **Wine industry**: Sales/CRM tools and terroir condition sampling underserved.
  - Key insight: **"Your competition is Excel."** Most underserved industries rely on spreadsheets — the real competitor isn't other software.
- **Our Angle**: Pick one of these underserved verticals, deeply learn the workflow, and build a simple tool that replaces their Excel/paper process. The construction temporary labor tracking and manufactured housing dealership management stand out as completely unserved.
- **LTD Potential**: 5

## "SaaS System of Record Is Cooked" — Vertical SaaS Opportunity Signal
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46917886
- **Additional Links**: None
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Tell HN discussion
- **Engagement**: 103 upvotes, 46 comments (strong signal)
- **Revenue Data**: None directly, but discusses enterprise SaaS margin compression
- **Boring Business Score**: 3 (meta-discussion about SaaS landscape)
- **Target Industry**: Enterprise SaaS landscape analysis
- **Core Value Prop**: Senior PM (20 years experience) argues large system-of-record SaaS companies are threatened by AI agents, open-source alternatives (Cal.com, Twenty CRM), and value migration to "agent layer" and "data layer."
- **Gap/Opportunity**: As enterprise SaaS gets disrupted from above (AI) and below (open-source), the opportunity shifts to vertical-specific tools where domain knowledge matters more than generic features. Open-source + AI makes it cheaper than ever to build SaaS — the differentiator becomes industry expertise. Thread confirms: small, focused, vertical tools with real domain knowledge will win vs. bloated horizontal platforms.
- **Our Angle**: Use open-source foundations (Cal.com for scheduling, Twenty for CRM) and add vertical-specific features for boring industries. Ship faster, charge less, win on domain understanding. The tech moat is dead — the domain moat is everything.
- **LTD Potential**: 3

## Liinks — Link-in-Bio Tool ($25k MRR by Undercutting)
- **Source**: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/tech/solo-founder-carved-a-25k-mo-niche-out-of-a-saturated-market-by-undercutting-the-competition-rRxyYFmG95zcSKSYdtM8
- **Additional Links**: https://liinks.co (implied)
- **Platform**: Indie Hackers
- **Type**: Revenue milestone / Interview
- **Engagement**: Featured post on IH
- **Revenue Data**: $25k MRR. Premium $4/mo, Pro $10/mo. ~$100 LTV per customer. 4.5 years to reach milestone. Google Ads: $1/click, $30/conversion.
- **Boring Business Score**: 1 (creator economy, not boring industry)
- **Target Industry**: Social media creators (link-in-bio)
- **Core Value Prop**: Cleaner, cheaper Linktree alternative. Undercut on price, win on UX simplicity. Removed free tier to reduce abuse/fraud. Fewer than 5 support requests weekly.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Not a boring business itself, but the playbook is highly relevant: enter a saturated market, undercut aggressively on price (enabled by lean solo operations), win on UX simplicity, remove the free tier. This exact strategy works for boring industries — most trades software is overpriced and bloated.
- **Our Angle**: Apply the "undercut and simplify" playbook to an existing boring-industry vertical SaaS. Find the GorillaDesk/Jobber/ServiceTitan of a specific trade, build 80% of the features at 30% of the price, with 10x better onboarding.
- **LTD Potential**: 2

## Samuel Rondot's SaaS Portfolio ($28k/mo) — Portfolio Strategy

- **Platform**: Indie Hackers
- **Type**: Revenue milestone / Interview
- **Engagement**: Featured post on IH
- **Revenue Data**: StoryShort.ai ~$20k/mo, UseArtemis.co ~$5k/mo (declining — LinkedIn tightening automation), Capacity.so ~$3k/mo. Total $28k/mo.
- **Boring Business Score**: 1 (AI/content tools, not boring)
- **Target Industry**: Content marketing, LinkedIn automation, no-code building
- **Core Value Prop**: Portfolio approach — multiple products, same tech stack (Next.js, Node, MongoDB, Vercel+AWS), SEO + paid ads for distribution.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Not boring businesses, but the portfolio strategy is relevant: use identical tech stack across products, validate with search volume/SEO metrics/competitor analysis before building, rely on SEO for compounding growth. Apply this to boring verticals.
- **Our Angle**: Build a portfolio of 3-5 boring-industry micro-SaaS tools using the same tech stack. Each targets a different trade vertical. Cross-sell between them. Use SEO to own niche keywords in each vertical.
- **LTD Potential**: 2

# Key Themes & Patterns

## Highest-Signal Opportunities (NEW this scan)

1. **Small-Batch Manufacturer Production Management** (Craftplan signal — 577 upvotes!): Bakeries, soap makers, breweries, candle makers — all outgrowing spreadsheets but can't afford $10k-50k/yr ERPs. Build a hosted version at $39-99/mo. Boring Business Score: 5. LTD Potential: 5.

## Recurring Patterns

- **"Boring problems have strong moats"** — curated databases, operational tools, and industry-specific workflows are harder to replicate than AI wrappers
- **"Your competition is Excel"** — most underserved industries rely on spreadsheets, not competing software
- **SEO dominance in niche keywords** is the #1 growth channel for boring-business SaaS (Stagetimer, Khasanov portfolio, JustFax Online)
- **Hybrid pricing** (subscription + one-time) outperforms pure SaaS in markets where customers buy infrequently (events, construction projects)
- **Domain expertise > tech sophistication** — the $10k/mo industry CRM runs on PHP/jQuery and a $4/mo server; the moat is understanding the workflow
- **Enterprise SaaS disruption creates space below** — as ServiceTitan/Jobber move upmarket, micro-operators get left behind
- **The "undercut and simplify" playbook** works: enter a market with expensive, bloated incumbents, build 80% of features at 30% of the price
- **Open-source + AI = cheaper to build** — the barrier to entry for vertical SaaS has never been lower; differentiation is domain knowledge
- **"Dead" technologies still alive in boring industries** — fax, EDI, legacy formats. No competition, steady revenue.
- **Portfolio approach** — build 3-5 boring-industry tools on the same stack, cross-sell, compound SEO across verticals
