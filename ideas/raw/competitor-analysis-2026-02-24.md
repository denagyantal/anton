## 1. Field Service Management: The $59-$99 LTD Opportunity for Solo Operators

### Market Landscape

The FSM market is dominated by expensive, complex platforms designed for 20+ technician operations. 94% of FSM software users are small businesses (1-50 employees), yet the software is built for enterprise.

| Competitor | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| ServiceTitan | $250-$500/tech/mo + $5K-$50K implementation | Market leader (~$772M ARR), comprehensive, IPO'd (TTAN) | Absurdly expensive, 12-month contracts, 12-week onboarding, overkill for small shops |
| Jobber | $39-$349/mo + $29/extra user | 250K+ users, strong brand, easy to start | Add-ons push true cost to $993/mo; QuickBooks sync unreliable; adding 1 employee forces $39→$169 plan jump |
| Housecall Pro | $69-$329/mo + paid add-ons | 200K+ pros, good UX, no contracts | Add-on cost creep (#1 reason users leave); support degraded to AI-only in 2025; QuickBooks locked behind $149+ tier |
| FieldEdge | ~$100/office + $125/tech/mo | No contracts, month-to-month | Per-user pricing adds up fast for small teams |
| Workiz | $229/mo (5 users) + $46/extra user | Good for locksmith/appliance niches | High entry price, per-user scaling |
| FieldPulse | ~$89/mo + $30/extra user | "Swiss Army knife" for small teams | Not publicly priced, smaller brand |
| Service Fusion | Custom (no per-user fees) | Flat-rate pricing model | No free plan, custom quotes only |
| ServiceM8 | $0-$349/mo (per-job, unlimited users) | Per-job pricing, no per-user fees, free tier | Australian origin, less US brand recognition, job limits cap growth |
| Kickserv | $0-$239/mo | Free plan for 2 users, affordable | Fewer features, limited brand awareness |

### Top Customer Complaints (from reviews)

1. **Pricing escalation through add-ons** -- Housecall Pro's #1 complaint; Jobber's true cost can hit $993/mo with all needed add-ons. [Housecall Pro Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/housecallpro.com) | [Jobber Pricing Breakdown](https://myquoteiq.com/jobber-pricing-breakdown-2026/)
2. **Contract lock-in & cancellation nightmares** -- ServiceTitan's 12-month auto-renewing contracts, early termination fees, "beyond terrible" cancellation service. [ServiceTitan BBB](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/glendale/profile/digital-marketing/servicetitan-inc-1216-1290182/complaints)
3. **Enterprise complexity forced on small shops** -- ServiceTitan: "Does not work well for a company that wants to keep things simple." 94% of users are small businesses, but software is designed for large operations. [Software Advice Reviews](https://www.softwareadvice.com/field-service/servicetitan-profile/reviews/)
4. **Customer support degradation** -- Housecall Pro switched to AI-only support in 2025: "We couldn't talk to a human anymore." ServiceTitan: "Absolutely the worst customer service I've ever had." [Housecall Pro Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/housecallpro.com) | [ServiceTitan BBB Reviews](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/glendale/profile/digital-marketing/servicetitan-inc-1216-1290182/customer-reviews)
5. **QuickBooks integration failures** -- Cross-platform complaint: duplicate invoices, chart of accounts mapping failures, delayed syncs creating data discrepancies. [Lexul QuickBooks Comparison](https://www.lexul.com/comparing-10-quickbooks-integrations-in-field-service-software/)
6. **Mobile app instability** -- Housecall Pro Google Play: 3.3/5 stars; users "avoid the app altogether." [FieldCamp Housecall Pro Review](https://fieldcamp.ai/reviews/housecall-pro/)

### Identified Gap

- **What's missing**: A simple, affordable FSM tool for solo operators and 1-5 person trades shops. No competitor offers a lifetime deal. The cheapest credible paid option (ServiceM8 at $29/mo) still costs $1,740 over 5 years.
- **Who needs it**: Solo plumbers, HVAC techs, electricians, pest control operators running 1-5 person shops with revenue under $1M/year (63% of the market).
- **Why competitors don't do it**: Incumbents chase enterprise ARPU. ServiceTitan's average customer spends $78K/year. Venture-backed companies need recurring revenue to justify valuations.
- **Current workaround**: Google Calendar for scheduling, handwritten estimates, QuickBooks alone for invoicing, text messages for customer communication. Small operators cobble together 3-4 free tools.

### Our Opportunity

- **Product concept**: "QuickJob" -- a dead-simple quote→schedule→invoice→get-paid tool for solo/micro trades operators. No per-user fees, no enterprise bloat. 5-minute setup.
- **Key differentiator**: $79 lifetime deal vs. $468-$4,740 in 5-year subscription costs. Reliable QuickBooks sync (the #1 integration complaint). Flat-rate pricebook included free (Housecall Pro charges $149/mo for this). Ability to pass CC fees to clients (Jobber can't do this).
- **LTD price point**: $79
- **Target channels**: r/HVAC, r/Plumbing, r/electricians, r/smallbusiness, HVAC-Talk.com forums, Facebook groups for trade business owners, local PHCC/ACCA chapters
- **AppSumo potential**: Yes -- zero FSM tools currently on AppSumo. Uncontested category. 3.5M home service businesses in the US, 94% are small.

## 2. Auto Repair Shop Management: Simple Software for Independent Shops

### Market Landscape

174,000+ auto repair shops in the US. Market valued at $1.8B (2024), projected $4.2B by 2033. The small/medium shop segment is the fastest-growing at 9.2% CAGR, yet the cheapest full-featured option starts at $109/mo with per-user add-ons. Many shops still use paper tickets and whiteboards.

| Competitor | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Tekmetric | $199-$439/mo per shop | Market leader (13K+ shops), modern cloud UI, unlimited ROs, no per-user fees | Expensive for small shops, internet-dependent (no offline), integration issues, busy UI |
| Shop-Ware | $249-$799/mo per shop | Built by a shop owner, strong DVI, 89% work approval rate | Most expensive entry tier, no native phone app, inventory management complaints |
| Shopmonkey | $125-$425/mo | Largest funded ($110M), broadest features, payment processing | V2.0 UX regression, QuickBooks sync removed, "customer service is a JOKE" |
| AutoLeap | $179/mo + setup fee | Modern UI, strong feature breadth, well-funded ($54M) | Annual contract lock-in with 60-day notice, terrible support, missing promised features |
| Shop Boss | $199-$399/mo | Solid mid-range option | Limited differentiation |
| Mitchell 1 Manager SE | ~$300-$500/mo bundled | Comprehensive repair data, long-tenured, Snap-on family | Outdated server-based UI ("looks like Excel"), 2-year contracts, no mobile access, predatory billing |
| AutoFluent | $109/mo + $25/user | Lowest base price among full-featured options | Per-user charges add up, less modern UI |
| R.O. Writer | Quote-based (Bronze/Silver/Gold) | Solid for established shops | "Cost is a little high with add-ons needed" |
| ARI | Free to start | Zero barrier to entry, "costs for one year what competitors cost in one month" | Limited features, small dev team |

### Top Customer Complaints (from reviews)

1. **Pricing out of reach for small shops** -- At $179-$250/mo, software costs 2-6% of gross revenue for 1-3 bay shops. "The cheapest tier is kind of expensive for startup businesses with low capital." [Capterra Shop-Ware](https://www.capterra.com/p/153469/Shop-Ware/)
2. **Outdated UI on legacy platforms** -- Mitchell 1: "Outdated system... very Excel spreadsheet layout and no plans to change." Shopmonkey V2.0 described as "regression" that "took a very smooth easy-to-use software and made it much harder to use." [Capterra Mitchell 1](https://www.capterra.com/p/145351/Manager-SE/reviews/) | [Software Advice Shopmonkey](https://www.softwareadvice.com/auto-repair/shopmonkey-profile/reviews/)
3. **Contract lock-in** -- AutoLeap: annual agreements with 60-day notice periods, company "will not help" if notice period missed. Mitchell 1: 2-year contracts, unauthorized charges. [Capterra AutoLeap](https://www.capterra.com/p/216500/Autoleap/reviews/) | [BBB Mitchell 1](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/san-diego/profile/auto-repair-equipment/mitchell1-1126-29000405/complaints)
4. **QuickBooks integration constantly broken** -- Shopmonkey deprecated sync entirely; users "now creating double entries." Tekmetric PartsTech integration "had issues all the time." [Software Advice Shopmonkey](https://www.softwareadvice.com/auto-repair/shopmonkey-profile/reviews/)
5. **Customer support failures across the board** -- AutoLeap: "Customer service terrible and unprofessional." Shopmonkey: "Support was described as pathetic, and they provide NO training." [Trustpilot AutoLeap](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/autoleap.com) | [Capterra Shopmonkey](https://www.capterra.com/p/169022/Shopmonkey/reviews/)
6. **No offline capability** -- Every cloud-based tool fails during internet outages. Tekmetric: "If internet connection is lost, shops lose all of their systems." [Capterra Tekmetric](https://www.capterra.com/p/190952/Tekmetric/reviews/)

### Identified Gap

- **What's missing**: A modern, affordable, simple shop management tool in the $49-$99/mo range for 1-3 bay independent shops. No major player offers offline capability. No lifetime deal options exist.
- **Who needs it**: Independent auto repair shops with 1-3 bays, owner-operators who are also the lead technician and service writer. The fastest-growing adoption segment (9.2% CAGR).
- **Why competitors don't do it**: VC-funded companies (Shopmonkey: $110M, AutoLeap: $54M) chase higher ARPU. Legacy players (Mitchell 1/Snap-on) are locked into enterprise contracts. Even the "budget" option (AutoFluent at $109/mo) charges per-user fees.
- **Current workaround**: Paper repair order tickets, whiteboards for job scheduling, Excel for customer tracking, pen + calculator for estimates, QuickBooks alone for invoicing. Paper forms "have been trusted by repair shops since 1965."

### Our Opportunity

- **Product concept**: "BayBoard" -- a clean, mobile-first shop management tool for 1-3 bay independent shops. Digital RO creation, visual job board (drag-and-drop scheduling), estimates/invoicing, two-way customer texting with logged conversations, and offline mode with cloud sync.
- **Key differentiator**: $69/mo all-inclusive (no per-user fees, no setup fees, no contracts) OR $499 lifetime deal. Offline-capable (unique in the market). 5-minute onboarding with paper-to-digital migration wizard. Built-in two-way texting with conversation logging (Shop-Ware can't do this). Reliable QuickBooks sync.
- **LTD price point**: $499 (or $69/mo subscription) -- positioned well below Tekmetric's $199/mo and Shop-Ware's $249/mo
- **Target channels**: r/MechanicAdvice, r/AutoMechanic, r/smallbusiness, iATN forums, ASA (Automotive Service Association) chapters, NAPA AutoCare/ACDelco TSS shop owner groups, Facebook groups for independent shop owners
- **AppSumo potential**: Yes -- no auto shop management software exists on AppSumo. Higher price point ($499 LTD) justified by niche value and lack of alternatives.

## 3. Cleaning Service Management: Mobile-First for Growing Micro-Businesses

### Market Landscape

Cleaning service software market: $1.98B (2025), projected $2.92B by 2029 (~10.2% CAGR). The market is split between expensive generalist tools (Jobber, Housecall Pro) and niche cleaning-specific tools with meaningful limitations. Solo operators and micro-teams (1-10 cleaners) are poorly served.

| Competitor | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| ZenMaid | $19-$49/mo + $4-$24/seat | Purpose-built for residential cleaning, well-known in maid service community | Per-seat costs escalate fast; no payroll integration; no phone support; Google Play 3.2/5; key features locked to MAX tier |
| Jobber | $39-$349/mo + $29/user | 300K+ users, strong brand, 50+ industries | Generalist (not cleaning-specific); expensive at scale; QuickBooks sync unreliable; mobile app lacks offline |
| Housecall Pro | $79-$329/mo | 200K+ pros, good UX | Add-on cost creep; cancellation nightmares; aggressive sales calls; QuickBooks locked behind $149+ tier |
| Swept | $30-$225/mo per location band | Only major commercial janitorial platform, multi-language | App crashes repeatedly; GPS inconsistent; "does not listen to end-user requests"; overpriced for just timekeeping |
| BookingKoala | Free-$27+/mo | Free tier, online booking focus | DOWN FOR TWO WEEKS in March 2025; hostile management; feature stagnation |
| Launch27/Automaid | $59-$299/mo | Cleaning-specific, client self-service | QuickBooks + SMS locked behind $125+; mobile app locked behind $299+; dated platform |
| CleanGuru | $59-$99/mo + $3/cleaner | Dominant in janitorial bidding niche (250K+ proposals), 10+ years | Bidding/proposal focused, not full operations management |
| MaidCentral | $450+/mo | Most comprehensive cleaning-specific tool, handles payroll natively | Extremely expensive, only for established operations |
| Maidily | $25-$100/mo | Budget-friendly, cleaning-specific | Less well-known, fewer integrations, limited market presence |
| ServiceM8 | $0-$349/mo (no per-user fees) | Per-account pricing (not per-user), free tier | Australian origin, not cleaning-specific |

### Top Customer Complaints (from reviews)

1. **Per-user pricing gets expensive fast** -- ZenMaid at $49 + $24/seat means a 5-person team pays $169/mo. Jobber at $349/mo for 10 users. Every review platform mentions this. [Jobber G2 Pros and Cons](https://www.g2.com/products/jobber/reviews?qs=pros-and-cons)
2. **Key features locked behind top tiers** -- ZenMaid: PTO tracking, data export, Zapier need MAX plan. Jobber: GPS and QuickBooks need Connect ($169+). Launch27: mobile app needs Plus ($299+). [ZenMaid Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/133875/ZenMaid-Software/reviews/)
3. **Mobile apps are buggy or incomplete** -- ZenMaid Google Play: 3.2/5. Swept: "App closes mid-use," users forced to reinstall repeatedly. [Swept Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/148615/Swept/reviews/)
4. **Platform reliability disasters** -- BookingKoala was DOWN FOR TWO WEEKS in March 2025. "Clients couldn't book, cleaners couldn't be scheduled, users lost thousands in revenue." Compensation: one-month credit. [BookingKoala Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.bookingkoala.com)
5. **No payroll integration** -- ZenMaid cannot integrate with Gusto. Most platforms require separate payroll software. Only MaidCentral ($450+/mo) handles payroll natively. [Connecteam ZenMaid Review](https://connecteam.com/reviews/zenmaid/)
6. **QuickBooks sync unreliable** -- Jobber's integration "prone to sync errors." ZenMaid: "Cannot bill directly from ZenMaid if using QuickBooks." [Jobber Capterra Reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/127994/Jobber/reviews/)

### Identified Gap

- **What's missing**: A mobile-first, cleaning-specific tool at $29-$49/mo flat rate (no per-user fees) that handles scheduling, invoicing, basic CRM, and team communication for 1-10 person cleaning businesses. No single affordable tool combines all these.
- **Who needs it**: The "growing micro-business" -- solo cleaners scaling to 3-10 employees. They've outgrown Google Calendar + Venmo but can't justify $150+/mo for Jobber or Housecall Pro.
- **Why competitors don't do it**: Generalist tools (Jobber, HCP) don't optimize for cleaning workflows (recurring jobs, checklists, team swaps). Niche tools (ZenMaid, Swept) add per-seat/per-location costs that penalize growth.
- **Current workaround**: Google Calendar for scheduling, WhatsApp groups for team communication, Venmo/Zelle for payment, pen-and-paper checklists. "Generic field-service solutions aren't built for the way cleaning businesses actually operate."

### Our Opportunity

- **Product concept**: "CleanSlate" -- a mobile-first scheduling + invoicing + team management app built specifically for residential and small commercial cleaning businesses. Recurring job management, cleaning checklists with photo verification, client portal, team messaging, and automated payment collection.
- **Key differentiator**: $39/mo flat rate for unlimited team members (no per-user fees -- like ServiceM8's model but cleaning-specific). Mobile-first (not desktop-first with a mobile app bolted on). Built-in team messaging (replaces WhatsApp). Gusto payroll integration included.
- **LTD price point**: $79
- **Target channels**: r/CleaningTips, r/EntrepreneurRideAlong (cleaning business niche is huge here), r/smallbusiness, Cleaning Business Builders Facebook group, CleanFax magazine/forums, ISSA cleaning industry association
- **AppSumo potential**: Yes -- cleaning business owners are active AppSumo buyers. The "EntrepreneurRideAlong" Reddit community has thousands of members running cleaning businesses seeking affordable software.

## 4. Property Management: All-in-One for the 5-20 Unit Landlord

### Market Landscape

9.72 million tax-paying Americans own rental property. 80% of individual-landlord properties are owner-managed (~21M self-managed units). 42% of landlords own just 1 unit, 33% own 2-4, 16% own 5-10. The PM software market is $3.61B (2025), projected $5.89B by 2033. Small landlords face a "dead zone" in pricing -- free tools lack depth, per-unit pricing makes mid-tier tools surprisingly expensive.

| Competitor | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| AppFolio | $1.49-$5/unit/mo, $250/mo minimum | 98% customer satisfaction, 5M+ units managed | **50-unit minimum** -- completely excludes small landlords |
| Buildium | $58-$375/mo | Strong brand, 15K+ customers, owned by RealPage | Hidden fees ($99/bank account on Essential), surprise price increases, "not a priority if you don't have 50+ units" |
| DoorLoop | $49-$79/mo (20 units) | Modern UI | Buggy at critical points, undisclosed merchant account fees, refund difficulties |
| TenantCloud | $15-$50/mo | Affordable mid-range | Eliminated free plan (upset users), unauthorized charges reported, transfers much slower than claimed |
| RentRedi | $9-$20/mo (unlimited units) | Flat-rate unlimited units, mobile-first, BiggerPockets marketing | $1 ACH fee per transaction, support wait times, billing glitches |
| TurboTenant | Free-$12.42/mo | Free-forever plan, unlimited units, 650K+ landlords | Free tier lacks depth, expedited features gated to paid tiers |
| Avail (Realtor.com) | Free-$9/unit/mo | Free plan covers basics | **No mobile app**, waived ACH only on paid plan |
| Stessa (Roofstock) | Free-$28/mo | Best free financial tracking, Schedule E automation | Weak on tenant management, bank connections break, "customer service almost non-existent" |
| Innago | Free (core) | 4.9/5 on G2 and Capterra (~1K reviews), 100% free core | $20 one-time fee per lease signed, newer/smaller |
| Baselane | Free-$20/mo | Landlord banking + bookkeeping + rent collection, auto-categorizes 120+ Schedule E categories | Newer player, limited feature depth |
| Landlord Studio | Free (3 units)-$12/mo | Mobile-first, accounting-focused, Schedule E reports | Limited to accounting/tracking, not full PM |

### Top Customer Complaints (from reviews)

1. **Per-unit pricing punishes small landlords** -- Hemlane at $30-$60/unit/mo means a 10-unit landlord pays $300-$600/month. Avail at $9/unit means $90/mo for 10 units just for waived ACH fees. [Shuk Rentals Buildium Review](https://www.shukrentals.com/post/buildium-review-pricing-pros-and-cons-for-landlords)
2. **Hidden fees and surprise price increases** -- Buildium: $99/bank account on Essential; real costs 30-50% above base. DoorLoop: "undisclosed additional merchant account fees." TenantCloud: unauthorized credit card charges. [Capterra Buildium](https://www.capterra.com/p/47428/Buildium-Property-Management-Software/reviews/) | [BBB DoorLoop](https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/hollywood/profile/project-management-software/doorloop-inc-0633-90612238/complaints)
3. **Support neglects small accounts** -- Buildium: "I waited days for support and felt like I wasn't a priority because I didn't have 50+ units." Stessa: "Can't get help from a human in a timely fashion." DoorLoop: "Issues remaining unresolved for up to three weeks." [Trustpilot Stessa](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/stessa.com) | [Trustpilot DoorLoop](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/doorloop.com)
4. **Software built for PM companies, not DIY landlords** -- AppFolio requires 50+ units. Buildium: "If you're a solo landlord with one or a few properties, you'll be paying for features you'll never use." [FinanceStu Buildium Review](https://financestu.com/buildium-review/)
5. **Buggy software and broken integrations** -- DoorLoop: "Web services are buggy at critical points." Stessa: "Bank connections break and when you reconnect all prior history is lost." Avail: "No mobile app" in 2025. [G2 DoorLoop](https://www.g2.com/products/doorloop/reviews?qs=pros-and-cons) | [Capterra Stessa](https://www.capterra.com/p/181042/Stessa/reviews/)
6. **Billing and cancellation issues** -- RentRedi: "Due to a glitch with Stripe they never stopped billing" for 10 months. TenantCloud: "Credit cards charged multiple times." [Trustpilot RentRedi](https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/rentredi.com) | [PissedConsumer TenantCloud](https://tenantcloud.pissedconsumer.com/review.html)

### Identified Gap

- **What's missing**: A single, simple, affordable platform that seamlessly combines rent collection + automated bookkeeping/tax prep + maintenance tracking + lease management + tenant communication for landlords with 5-20 doors. No tool does all of this well without enterprise bloat.
- **Who needs it**: Self-managing landlords with 5-20 units who find free tools too basic and paid tools too expensive or complex. 40%+ of small landlords still rely on manual tools. 35% cite cost as the #1 barrier to adoption.
- **Why competitors don't do it**: Free tools monetize through lead gen or banking products (Stessa/Roofstock, Baselane). Mid-tier tools use per-unit pricing that misaligns incentives. Enterprise tools (AppFolio, Buildium) chase larger accounts.
- **Current workaround**: Landlords cobble together Stessa (accounting) + TurboTenant (listings/screening) + Venmo (payments) + text messages (maintenance). "Manual tools fall apart once they add a second unit or new tenant."

### Our Opportunity

- **Product concept**: "DoorSimple" -- one unified tool for the 5-20 unit self-managing landlord. Online rent collection with automated reminders and late fees, expense tracking with receipt scanning and auto-categorization to Schedule E line items, maintenance request portal linked to vendor coordination and tax categories, lease creation with e-signatures and renewal alerts, and tenant communication hub with audit trail.
- **Key differentiator**: $15/mo flat rate for unlimited units (vs. per-unit pricing). Schedule E tax automation that replaces an accountant ($500+ savings per property at tax time). Transparent pricing with zero hidden fees (competitive weapon in a market plagued by fee surprises). Mobile-first with reliable app (Avail has no app; Stessa's bank connections break).
- **LTD price point**: $99
- **Target channels**: r/realestateinvesting, r/landlord, r/RealEstate, BiggerPockets forums, Facebook groups for rental property investors, local REIA (Real Estate Investors Association) chapters
- **AppSumo potential**: Yes -- strong. Landlords are cost-conscious buyers who respond well to lifetime deals. Tax automation is the killer feature that converts spreadsheet users. Clear ROI story: "$99 one-time vs. $500+/year in accounting savings."

## Summary: Opportunity Ranking

| Rank | Category | LTD Price | Market Size | Competition Gap | Ease to Build | Overall Score |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Field Service Management** (solo trades) | $79 | 3.5M businesses, 94% small | No LTD competitors exist; zero AppSumo presence | Medium | Highest |
| 2 | **Property Management** (5-20 unit landlords) | $99 | 9.7M landlords, 80% self-managing | "Dead zone" between free and enterprise | Medium | High |
| 3 | **Cleaning Service Management** (1-10 cleaners) | $79 | $1.98B market, 10.2% CAGR | No affordable mobile-first cleaning-specific tool | Medium-Low | High |
| 4 | **Auto Repair Shop Management** (1-3 bay shops) | $499 | 174K shops, 9.2% CAGR | Cheapest credible option is $109/mo + per-user fees | Medium-High | Medium-High |

### Cross-Category Patterns

1. **Per-user pricing is universally hated.** Every category shows the same complaint. Flat-rate or per-account pricing is a consistent differentiator.
2. **QuickBooks integration is table stakes but universally broken.** Reliable sync would be a competitive advantage across all 4 categories.
3. **Customer support degrades as companies scale.** Small customers feel deprioritized. Responsive human support is a repeatable competitive moat.
4. **No lifetime deals exist in any of these categories.** This is a genuine white space across all 4 markets.
5. **Mobile-first is expected but rarely delivered well.** Mobile app ratings consistently lag desktop experience across all platforms.
6. **The "complexity tax" hurts small operators.** Software designed for 50+ employee operations is being sold to 1-5 person shops. Opinionated simplicity wins.
