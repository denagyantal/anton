## Veterinary Practice Management: The Legacy Server Exodus

### Market Landscape

Market size: $435M (2025), projected $732M by 2032 (CAGR 7.7%). The market splits sharply between legacy server-based systems (Avimark, Cornerstone) and modern cloud-native platforms (ezyVet, Shepherd, Vetspire). Veterinary servers crash frequently with replacements averaging ~$17,000, and updates/backups can consume hours of staff time. Limited adoption among small practices in rural areas with constrained budgets remains a key barrier. Cloud-based solutions are projected to show the strongest growth, driven by demand for remote access, automatic updates, and reduced IT costs.

| Competitor | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| IDEXX Cornerstone | Custom (call sales) | Established brand; deep IDEXX lab integration; comprehensive feature set | Server-based (not truly cloud); legacy architecture; expensive; tied to IDEXX ecosystem |
| Covetrus Avimark | Custom (call sales) | Established install base; 5/5 user rating; IDEXX-acquired | Server-based; customer support issues; account merging difficulties; legacy UI |
| ezyVet | ~$245/mo + implementation fees | Cloud-native; improved charting speed vs Cornerstone; better cost than Cornerstone | Overwhelming interface; "confusing, complicated" for new users; 1-3 month implementation; stingy integrations; no AI/voice features |
| Shepherd Vet | Custom (request demo) | AI-powered; modern cloud UI; new generation platform | Every SOAP letter requires opening different tab; newer/smaller user base; limited track record |
| Vetspire | Custom pricing | Efficient scheduling & invoicing; modern interface | Frequent glitches and system bugs; reliability concerns |
| DaySmart Vet | $116-$565/mo (1-20 users) | Published pricing; mobile app; easier onboarding | Less feature-rich than premium options; fewer integrations |
| Provet Cloud | Custom + per-feature charges | Cloud-native; whiteboard feature | Additional charges for advanced features; slow data migration from older platforms |
| VetPort | From $99/mo | Affordable; cloud-based; open API | Smaller market share; less established |

### Top Customer Complaints (from reviews)
1. **Legacy server systems are a ticking time bomb** -- server crashes averaging $17,000 to replace; hours of staff time consumed by updates, backups, and bug fixes - [DaySmart Vet Blog](https://www.daysmart.com/vet/blog/veterinary-practice-management-software-assessment/)
2. **Opaque, call-for-pricing models dominate** -- only DaySmart Vet and ezyVet publish starting prices; most vendors require sales calls - [NectarVet Cloud Software Comparison](https://www.nectarvet.com/post/best-cloud-based-vet-software-prices-reviews)
3. **Hidden setup/migration costs of $500-$2,000+** -- initial data migration, configuration, and training fees not disclosed upfront - [VetSyCare Pricing Guide](https://vetsycare.com/blog/veterinary-software-pricing-guide)
4. **ezyVet interface is overwhelming and confusing** -- "Confusing, complicated, multiple paths to get nowhere. Learning the system is a nightmare" - [ezyVet Capterra Reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/99977/ezyVet-Cloud-Vet-Software/reviews/)
5. **No AI or voice features in most platforms** -- "There currently neither AI features nor voice technology included with ezyVet, while these are already available in competing PIMs" - [ezyVet G2 Reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/ezyvet/reviews)
6. **Reporting capabilities are weak across the board** -- reminder systems difficult to use; programs lack substantial reporting - [Capterra Veterinary Software Reviews](https://www.capterra.com/veterinary-software/)

### Identified Gap
- **What's missing**: An affordable ($50-$100/mo), cloud-native veterinary PIMS for 1-3 vet small/solo practices with simple onboarding, AI-powered SOAP notes, integrated lab results, and transparent pricing
- **Who needs it**: Solo veterinarians, small rural clinics (1-3 vets), mobile/house-call vets, and specialty practices (exotic, equine) priced out of ezyVet/Cornerstone
- **Why competitors don't do it**: IDEXX and Covetrus are locked into server-based architectures with massive install bases; ezyVet targets larger multi-vet practices for higher ARPU; building lab integrations and medical record compliance is genuinely complex
- **Current workaround**: Avimark/Cornerstone on aging servers; spreadsheets for inventory; paper records in rural practices; some using generic appointment software with separate billing. Practices using dedicated software save 5-10 hours/week vs. manual methods.

### Our Opportunity
- **Product concept**: "VetSimple" -- cloud-native practice management for small vet clinics with AI-assisted SOAP notes (voice-to-text), integrated lab ordering, appointment scheduling, invoicing, client communication (text reminders), and inventory tracking. Single-page SOAP entry (not tabbed like Shepherd). Designed for 1-3 vet practices with same-week onboarding.
- **Key differentiator**: AI-powered SOAP notes (voice dictation in exam room), transparent flat pricing with no setup fees, same-week onboarding (not 1-3 months like ezyVet), and purpose-built for small practices instead of stripped-down enterprise software
- **LTD price point**: $149 (lifetime, 1 location up to 3 vets; $249 for up to 6 vets)
- **Target channels**: VIN (Veterinary Information Network) forums, r/veterinaryprofession, r/vettech, AVMA newsletters, state veterinary association Facebook groups, Veterinary Practice News, dvm360 community
- **AppSumo potential**: Maybe -- veterinary professionals are less AppSumo-native than other segments, but the cost savings vs $245+/mo ezyVet or $17K server replacements would be compelling. Better suited for direct outreach through vet forums and associations.

## Dental Practice Management: The Cloud Migration Goldmine

### Market Landscape

The dental practice management software market is dominated by two legacy server-based incumbents: Dentrix (Henry Schein) and Eaglesoft (Patterson). Both are now scrambling to offer cloud versions (Dentrix Ascend, Eaglesoft Fuse) that users describe as buggy and slow. Open Dental has emerged as the cost-effective open-source alternative at 41% less than the market average. Cloud-native challengers like Curve Dental, Oryx, and Tab32 target practices wanting modern UX without server headaches. Solo and small practices (1-3 chairs) face a stark choice between expensive legacy systems ($500+/mo) and newer tools that may lack feature depth.

| Competitor | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Dentrix (Henry Schein) | From $500/mo | Market leader; comprehensive feature set; works well for small practices | Server-based (on-premise); expensive; outdated UI; must pay monthly for tech support; reports don't export to Excel; confusing reports |
| Eaglesoft (Patterson) | Custom (call sales) | Large install base; established brand | Server-based; feels old; poor modern integrations; no cloud access by default; users call Fuse migration "worst mistake ever" |
| Dentrix Ascend | Custom (cloud version) | Cloud-based; same vendor as Dentrix | Slow; buggy; too many clicks for radiographs; internet speed dependent; mixed migration reviews |
| Open Dental | $179/mo/location (support) | Open source; 41% cheaper than average; highly customizable; strong community | Server-based (requires local setup); live support requires paid plan; steeper learning curve; less polished UI |
| Curve Dental | From $200/mo | Cloud-native; clean interface; good for small teams | Newer company; may lack depth of legacy features |
| CareStack | From $698/mo/user | Feature-rich; cloud-native; all-in-one | Very expensive; overkill for solo/small practices |
| Oryx | Tiered pricing (lower entry) | Cloud-based; streamlined; good for small/independent practices | Pared-down features; newer/smaller user base |
| MOGO | Cloud; predictable monthly pricing | Simple; good for smaller teams; cloud-based | Fewer advanced features; smaller market share |
| Dental Intelligence | Analytics add-on | Strong practice analytics and patient engagement | "Complete lack of responsiveness"; unresolved billing issues; expensive as add-on |

### Top Customer Complaints (from reviews)
1. **Server-based systems are expensive to maintain and vulnerable** -- on-premise servers require IT, crash unexpectedly, and prevent remote access - [Aegis IT - Best Dental Software](https://thinkaegis.com/best-dental-software/)
2. **Dentrix pricing is prohibitive for small practices** -- starting at $500/mo, "very expensive" and "not worth the price" per multiple reviewers - [Dentrix Capterra Reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/2329/Dentrix/reviews/)
3. **Reports are universally terrible** -- Dentrix reports take long to run, don't export to Excel, produce inconsistent/inaccurate data, and are difficult to customize - [Dentrix G2 Reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/dentrix/reviews)
4. **Cloud migration is painful** -- Eaglesoft to Fuse described as "worst mistake ever"; Dentrix Ascend is slow and buggy - [Dentrix Ascend Community Forum](https://support.dentrixascend.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115007817328-OMG-SERIOUSLY-)
5. **Support quality is inconsistent** -- long hold times, difficulty reaching right person, slow email responses, issues not fully resolved - [Dentrix Software Advice Reviews](https://www.softwareadvice.com/dental/dentrix-profile/reviews/)
6. **Integration challenges with third-party tools** -- connecting to imaging, billing, and other practice tools requires additional configuration and cost - [Dentrix SelectHub Reviews](https://www.selecthub.com/p/dental-practice-management-software/dentrix/)

### Identified Gap
- **What's missing**: A cloud-native, all-in-one dental practice management system for solo/small practices (1-3 chairs) at $100-$200/month with modern UI, working reports that export to Excel/CSV, built-in patient communication, and painless onboarding
- **Who needs it**: Solo dentists opening new practices, small group practices (2-3 dentists), dental practices currently on aging Dentrix/Eaglesoft servers dreading the cloud migration, and practices in rural areas needing remote access
- **Why competitors don't do it**: Dentrix/Eaglesoft have massive server-based install bases and are conflicted about cannibalizing them; Open Dental is open source but still server-based; CareStack went upmarket ($698/mo); cloud challengers (Curve, Oryx) are still building feature depth
- **Current workaround**: Aging Dentrix/Eaglesoft servers with expensive IT support; some practices using Open Dental with self-managed servers; paper charts still exist in small rural practices; separate tools for patient communication, billing, and scheduling

### Our Opportunity
- **Product concept**: "ChairCloud" -- cloud-native dental practice management built for 1-3 chair practices. Scheduling, charting, imaging integration, treatment planning, billing/insurance claims, patient communication (text/email reminders), and a report builder that actually exports to Excel. AI-assisted insurance coding suggestions. Mobile-friendly for dentist-owners who want to check schedules from home.
- **Key differentiator**: Purpose-built for small practices at $129-$179/month (vs $500+ Dentrix, $698+ CareStack). Cloud-native from day one (not a bolted-on cloud version of legacy software). Reports that work. Same-week migration assistance from Dentrix/Eaglesoft.
- **LTD price point**: $199 (lifetime, 1 location up to 3 providers)
- **Target channels**: Dentaltown forums (largest dental professional community), r/dentistry, r/DentalSchool (catching new graduates), ADA newsletters, state dental association Facebook groups, Dental Economics magazine, The Dental Hacks podcast
- **AppSumo potential**: Unlikely -- dental professionals rarely shop AppSumo, and compliance/HIPAA concerns make LTD trust harder to establish. Better suited for direct marketing through dental professional channels and conference booths.

## Salon & Barbershop Management: The Commission Trap

### Market Landscape

Market size: $840M-$1.36B (2025-2026), projected $1.29-$1.69B by 2030 (CAGR 8.9-10.9%). Small and individual professionals control 52.1% of the market. Over 45,000 individual stylists and small salon owners use mobile-based management tools. The market is split between commission-based "free" platforms (Fresha), per-user subscription models (Vagaro, Mangomint), and ecosystem-locked tools (Square Appointments). Barbershops, nail-lash studios, and day spas each have distinct workflow needs (tip pooling for barbers, rapid ticket turnover for nails, room blocking for spas) that generic platforms don't fully address.

| Competitor | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Fresha | $19.95/mo (solo) or $14.95/mo/user (team) + 20% new client fee | 450K+ businesses; large marketplace; formerly free tier | 20% commission on marketplace bookings (min $6); clients must create Fresha account to book; overrides client info if shared credit cards; 7-day workspace deletion delay; no refunds |
| Vagaro | $23.99/mo + $10/additional user | 221K professionals; no marketplace commission; deep features | Up-charges for everything; pricing changed over time; software crashes during scheduling; slow page loads; account lock-out issues |
| Square Appointments | Free (solo) to paid plans | Unlimited staff calendars on free plan; integrated POS; 2.6%+$0.10 processing | Not salon-specific; limited salon features; tied to Square ecosystem |
| Mangomint | $165/mo+ per user | 4.9-star rating; best-in-class UX; powerful automation | Very expensive; not suited for solo providers; overkill for small shops |
| DaySmart Salon | Custom pricing | Established brand; feature-rich | Outdated feel; higher cost |
| Phorest | Custom pricing | Strong marketing tools; loyalty features | Expensive; difficult cost adjustment; heavier to implement |
| Squire | Custom (barbershop-specific) | Purpose-built for barbershops; strong brand | Rigid system; minimal control for owners; features locked behind complaints; terrible post-sale support; "disappear after signing contract" |
| Booksy | $29.99/mo | Mobile-first; marketplace presence; affordable | Marketplace dependence; smaller feature set |

### Top Customer Complaints (from reviews)
1. **Fresha's 20% marketplace commission is a hidden tax** -- "stuck paying 20% new client fees even if the client cancels"; regular clients charged as "new" if not pre-imported; can exceed $10K/year in fees - [The Salon Business - Fresha Review 2026](https://thesalonbusiness.com/fresha-review/)
2. **Fresha overrides client data** -- uses credit card name instead of client name; elderly clients' info deleted and replaced when sharing payment methods - [Salon Booking System - Fresha Alternatives](https://www.salonbookingsystem.com/blog/case-study/fresha-alternatives/)
3. **Vagaro crashes and slow performance** -- "crashed multiple times especially when creating appointments"; online program very slow with front desk line-ups - [Vagaro Capterra Reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/153752/Vagaro/reviews/)
4. **Squire is rigid and unresponsive** -- "worst customer service, they only care about selling the platform and disappear after signing the contract"; features locked unless users file complaints - [Squire Capterra Reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/153899/Squire-Barber-Appointment-App/)
5. **Mangomint is priced out of reach** -- at $165+/user/month, solo barbers and small salon owners can't justify the cost despite best-in-class UX - [The Salon Business - Mangomint Alternatives](https://thesalonbusiness.com/mangomint-alternatives/)
6. **No platform handles barber-specific needs well** -- tip pooling, walk-in queue management, chair rental vs. commission splits, and quick ticket turnover are afterthoughts in most platforms - [The Salon Business - Best Barbershop Software](https://thesalonbusiness.com/best-barbershop-software/)

### Identified Gap
- **What's missing**: A $15-$30/month barbershop/salon tool with walk-in queue management, tip pooling/splitting, chair rental tracking, simple booking (no account required for clients), and zero marketplace commissions
- **Who needs it**: Solo barbers, 2-5 chair barbershops, independent stylists renting chairs, and small salons tired of Fresha's commission model or Vagaro's instability
- **Why competitors don't do it**: Fresha monetizes through marketplace commissions (their business model depends on it); Mangomint targets high-end salons for higher ARPU; Square Appointments isn't salon-specific; Squire went upmarket with rigid enterprise features
- **Current workaround**: Square for payments + Instagram DMs for booking + paper walk-in list + tip apps like TipBrighter. Many solo barbers just use their phone calendar and Venmo.

### Our Opportunity
- **Product concept**: "ChairTime" -- a mobile-first booking and shop management tool built specifically for barbershops and small salons. Walk-in queue with estimated wait times (shown on a shop display/TV), online booking without requiring client accounts, tip pooling with configurable splits, chair rental tracking with automatic deductions, integrated POS, and simple end-of-day reporting. No marketplace, no commissions.
- **Key differentiator**: Only affordable tool combining walk-in queue management + tip pooling + chair rental tracking. Zero commissions on bookings. Mobile-first with in-shop TV display mode for walk-in queue. Clients book without creating an account (just phone number).
- **LTD price point**: $59 (lifetime, 1 location up to 5 chairs; $99 for unlimited chairs)
- **Target channels**: r/Barber, r/HairStylist, Barber Facebook groups, barbershop supply distributors, trade shows (Bronner Bros, Barber Connect), barbershop culture Instagram/TikTok influencers, beauty school placement programs
- **AppSumo potential**: Yes -- strong. Barbers and stylists are price-sensitive and deal-oriented. The "no commission" angle against Fresha is a powerful marketing hook. Solo barbers paying $24/mo for Vagaro would jump at a $59 LTD.

## Gym & Fitness Studio Management: The Mindbody Escape Hatch

### Market Landscape

Market size: $11.6B (2025), projected $38-$64B by 2032-2035 (CAGR 14-19%). The fitness studio management software segment alone is projected at $2.5B by 2031. Mindbody dominates brand recognition but is increasingly seen as overpriced, complex, and bloated -- most gym owners report using only ~40% of its features. Boutique studios represent the fastest-growing segment, adopting cloud-based platforms to reduce admin overhead. The market is splitting between all-in-one enterprise tools (Mindbody, Glofox) and affordable focused tools (Gymdesk, PushPress, Recess). Studios switching from Mindbody report saving 30-50%.

| Competitor | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Mindbody | ~$120+/mo (starter); custom enterprise | Largest brand recognition; deepest feature set; marketplace exposure | Too expensive for small gyms; complex/outdated workflows; long-term contracts; hidden costs for branded apps/integrations; offshore/slow support; gym owners use only ~40% of features |
| Glofox (ABC Fitness) | From $275/mo | Growing fast; better than Mindbody on pricing/UX for many; strong mobile | Full of glitches/bugs; nonexistent customer support; no 24/7 AI receptionist; costs not well explained; higher-end pricing |
| Gymdesk | From $75/mo | Budget-friendly; all features included at every tier; martial arts focused | Smaller user base; fewer integrations; less polished |
| PushPress | Free (high processing fees) to $159/mo (Pro) | Free tier available; modular pricing (Core, Grow, Train); CrossFit community strong | Free tier has high processing fees; modular pricing adds up; still building feature set |
| Recess | Free | Genuinely free; simple; fast setup; scheduling + payments + members | Feature-limited; no access control; new/smaller platform |
| StudioGrowth | Affordable (custom) | Very few complaints; simplicity + affordability + support valued | Newer platform; fewer advanced features vs. established competitors |
| Momence | ~$99+/mo | Strong for yoga/pilates studios; good UX | Mid-range pricing; focused on specific verticals |
| Mariana Tek | Custom | Boutique fitness-focused (vs. Mindbody's one-size-fits-all); great UX | Custom/enterprise pricing; not accessible for small independent gyms |
| FitSW | Low cost | Good coaching features for individual trainers | No access control; limited for multi-trainer gyms; lightweight |
| Zen Planner | ~$117+/mo | Good for martial arts/CrossFit; strong community features | Mid-high pricing; aging interface |

### Top Customer Complaints (from reviews)
1. **Mindbody is too expensive and complex for small gyms** -- "high cost, steep learning curve, dependence on integrations push many gyms to explore alternatives"; hidden costs for branded apps and key integrations - [Wellyx - Mindbody Review 2026](https://wellyx.com/blog/mindbody-review/)
2. **Gym owners use only 40% of Mindbody** -- "many gym owners say they only use about 40% of what's offered. The rest feels unnecessary or too complex" - [Gymdesk - Mindbody Review](https://gymdesk.com/blog/mindbody-review/)
3. **Glofox is buggy with poor support** -- "full of glitches and bugs"; "nonexistent customer support"; costs and features not well explained - [1Club - Best Gym Management Software 2026](https://www.1club.ai/blog/best-gym-management-software-2026)
4. **Long-term contracts limit flexibility** -- Mindbody and others lock gyms into annual contracts, problematic for seasonal or new businesses - [Mariana Tek - Mindbody Alternatives](https://www.marianatek.com/blog/mindbody-alternatives/)
5. **Branded app costs are hidden extras** -- getting your own branded app (vs. the Mindbody marketplace app) requires expensive add-ons - [time2book - Mindbody Alternatives 2025](https://www.time2book.me/blog/best-mindbody-alternatives-2025)
6. **Studios save 30-50% switching from Mindbody** -- this alone indicates systemic overpricing for the value delivered - [StudioGrowth - Mindbody Alternative](https://studiogrowth.com/mindbody-alternative/)

### Identified Gap
- **What's missing**: A $30-$75/month gym management platform for independent/boutique studios (1-2 locations) with class scheduling, member management, integrated payments, a basic branded booking page, and workout/programming tools -- without enterprise bloat or marketplace dependency
- **Who needs it**: Independent yoga studios, small CrossFit boxes, martial arts dojos, personal training studios, boutique pilates/barre studios, and any solo-to-small gym owner who finds Mindbody overwhelming and overpriced
- **Why competitors don't do it**: Mindbody's business model depends on high ARPU + marketplace; Glofox is chasing the Mindbody segment at $275/mo; budget tools (Gymdesk, PushPress) are still building feature completeness; free tools (Recess) lack advanced features
- **Current workaround**: Google Sheets for class schedules + Stripe for payments + WhatsApp groups for member communication + paper sign-in sheets. Some studios using Calendly or Acuity for booking + separate payment tools.

### Our Opportunity
- **Product concept**: "StudioBase" -- member management, class scheduling (recurring + drop-in), integrated payment processing, a branded booking page (no marketplace commission), workout/WOD programming, attendance tracking, and automated member communication (text/email). Designed for 1-location boutique studios. No access control hardware, no enterprise analytics, no marketplace.
- **Key differentiator**: All-inclusive at $49/month (vs. $120+ Mindbody, $275+ Glofox). Branded booking page included (not a $50+/mo add-on). Workout programming built in (CrossFit/martial arts coaches need this). No long-term contracts. Studios get their own booking URL, not a Mindbody marketplace listing.
- **LTD price point**: $79 (lifetime, 1 location, unlimited members; $129 for 2 locations)
- **Target channels**: r/crossfit, r/yoga, r/martialarts, r/personaltraining, CrossFit affiliate owner Facebook groups, yoga teacher training communities, NASM/ACE certified trainer networks, boutique fitness trade shows (IHRSA), local gym owner meetups
- **AppSumo potential**: Yes -- strong. Fitness studio owners are entrepreneurial and cost-conscious. The "switch from Mindbody and save 30-50%" messaging is proven to resonate. Boutique fitness studios are growing rapidly and actively seeking affordable alternatives. CrossFit affiliate owners in particular are known deal-seekers in online communities.

## Cross-Category Patterns

### Universal Themes Across All 4 Markets

1. **Legacy server-based software is dying but not dead.** Both dental (Dentrix/Eaglesoft) and veterinary (Avimark/Cornerstone) markets are dominated by server-based incumbents whose cloud migrations are consistently described as buggy, slow, and painful. This creates a massive window for cloud-native challengers who get it right from day one.

2. **The "commission on bookings" model breeds resentment.** Fresha's 20% marketplace commission and Mindbody's marketplace dependency are top complaints. Transparent subscription pricing with zero commissions is a powerful differentiator in both salon and fitness markets.

3. **Pricing opacity is endemic in healthcare-adjacent software.** Veterinary and dental software vendors overwhelmingly use "call for pricing" models. Simply publishing prices is differentiation. Practices report spending hours on sales calls before even learning what a product costs.

4. **Small operators subsidize enterprise features they never use.** Gym owners use only 40% of Mindbody. Solo dentists pay for multi-location Dentrix features. Small vet clinics pay for enterprise-grade ezyVet features. Purpose-built tools for the 1-3 provider/chair/location segment are universally underserved.

5. **AI is the next battleground.** Veterinary AI SOAP notes, dental AI coding suggestions, AI-powered booking optimization, and AI workout programming are all emerging but not yet standard. First movers who nail AI for these specific use cases will win disproportionate attention and adoption.

6. **Mobile-first is table stakes, yet most incumbents fail at it.** Vagaro crashes on mobile. Mindbody's mobile UX is criticized. Vet software mobile apps lag behind desktop versions. The practitioner who is also the business owner needs to manage their business from their phone -- period.

7. **Support quality declines as platforms scale.** Every category shows the same pattern: small challenger has great support, grows, support degrades, users switch to next small challenger. Being the "company that actually answers the phone" is repeatedly cited as a reason for switching.

### Opportunity Ranking

| Rank | Category | Market Size | Gap Severity | LTD Viability | Community Strength | Overall Score |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Salon & Barbershop** | $840M-$1.36B | Very High (Fresha commission trap; no barber-specific tool) | Excellent ($59 LTD vs $24/mo Vagaro + commissions) | Strong (barber culture, Instagram, trade shows) | Strongest |
| 2 | **Gym & Fitness Studio** | $11.6B+ | Very High (Mindbody overpriced; 30-50% savings on switch) | Strong ($79 LTD vs $120+/mo Mindbody) | Very Strong (CrossFit, yoga, martial arts communities) | Very Strong |
| 3 | **Veterinary Practice** | $435M | High (legacy server exodus; small clinics priced out) | Moderate ($149 LTD; vet professionals less deal-seeking) | Good (VIN, AVMA, vet forums) | Strong |
| 4 | **Dental Practice** | Large (dominated by Henry Schein/Patterson) | High (server-to-cloud transition; small practices priced out) | Lower ($199 LTD; HIPAA trust barrier; less AppSumo fit) | Good (Dentaltown, ADA) | Good |
