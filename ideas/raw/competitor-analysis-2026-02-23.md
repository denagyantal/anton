## Field Service Management (HVAC/Plumbing/Electrical): Simple Scheduling & Invoicing for Solo/Small Contractors

### Market Landscape

Market size: **USD 5.49 billion (2025)**, projected **USD 9.17-23.6B by 2030-2035** at 12-16% CAGR. The market leader ServiceTitan is built for enterprise — small teams (1-5 techs) consistently report being priced out and overwhelmed by complexity. Nearly 28% of small businesses face implementation challenges due to limited IT resources. The solo contractor and 1-5 tech shop is the most underserved segment.

| Competitor | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| ServiceTitan | $259-$2,500+/mo (5-tech team: $1,000-1,700/mo) | Most comprehensive: scheduling, dispatching, pricebook, inventory, marketing, reporting. IPO-track company | Extremely expensive, 6-12 week onboarding, "TERRIBLE" support (G2), "complicated" and "excessively rigid," small teams can't extract value, expensive add-ons |
| Housecall Pro | $59/mo (Basic 1-user) - $329+/mo (Max) | Mobile-friendly, easy setup, drag-and-drop scheduling, real-time dispatching, strong for small-mid teams | Basic plan limited to 1 user with no QuickBooks integration, add-ons expensive ($20-149/mo each), mobile app has bugs/crashes, buried phone support |
| Jobber | $39/mo (Core 1-user) - $349/mo (Grow 10-user) | Clean UI, strong scheduling, route optimization praised by users, 14-day free trial, phone support answers in 3-5 min | Extra users $29/mo each, credit card processing fees can't be passed to clients, QuickBooks sync errors, slow run speed, add-ons (AI Receptionist $99/mo, Marketing $79/mo) push real cost to $300+/mo |
| FieldPulse | $99/mo (1 user) - custom pricing | Customer management, estimates, invoicing, GPS tracking, payment processing | Less established brand, pricing scales quickly with users, fewer integrations than leaders |
| ServiceM8 | Free (limited) - $379/mo | Strong in Australia/NZ market, job management, online booking, asset management | Limited traction in US, fewer native integrations, less feature-rich at lower tiers |
| Kickserv | $47-$239/mo | Affordable entry point, CRM, scheduling, invoicing, payment processing, good for solo/small residential contractors | Limited brand recognition, fewer advanced features (no robust pricebook or inventory), less mobile polish |
| Field Complete | **Free** (basic) | Free CRM, estimates, scheduling, dispatching, invoicing, mobile app | Limited as full business management solution, monetization unclear, fewer integrations |
| RazorSync | ~$65-200/mo | Mobile-friendly, job scheduling, dispatching, invoicing, GPS tracking, affordable for small teams | Smaller user base, less ecosystem of integrations, dated UI compared to newer entrants |
| FieldEdge (Xplor) | Custom pricing (~$100-300+/mo) | Built for HVAC/plumbing/electrical specifically, QuickBooks integration, dispatch board | Opaque pricing, contract requirements reported, mixed reviews on support quality |
| Workiz | $65/mo (Lite) - custom | Built for field service, call tracking, online booking, team management | Per-user pricing adds up, some features locked to higher tiers, primarily targets larger teams |

### Top Customer Complaints (from reviews)

1. **ServiceTitan is built for enterprise, not small shops** — "small teams warned about cost, complexity, and the painful implementation process" on r/HVAC, r/plumbing, r/electricians. 5-tech teams pay $1,000-1,700/mo — [OneCrew](https://www.getonecrew.com/post/servicetitan-reviews), [FieldCamp](https://fieldcamp.ai/reviews/servicetitan/)
2. **ServiceTitan support is "TERRIBLE"** — G2 review (June 2025): "The product is complicated, which means you need help regularly, but their product support is TERRIBLE." Tickets drag on for weeks — [OneCrew](https://www.getonecrew.com/post/servicetitan-reviews)
3. **ServiceTitan onboarding failures** — Some users report "We have NEVER BEEN ONBOARDED. At this point, we have currently paid for 1 year of Service Titan even though we do not use the software" — [FieldCamp](https://fieldcamp.ai/reviews/servicetitan/)
4. **Housecall Pro support buried behind AI** — Phone number exists but is "intentionally buried and not found on their website homepage or in the app's help section" per Facebook group discussions (Dec 2025-Jan 2026) — [Kore Komfort Solutions](https://korekomfortsolutions.com/jobber-vs-housecall-pro-support-which-software-actually-answers-the-phone-when-youre-stuck/)
5. **Housecall Pro mobile app crashes** — "frustrating bugs and crashes within the mobile app, causing some users avoiding the app altogether in favor of the desktop version" — [FieldPulse](https://www.fieldpulse.com/resources/blog/housecall-pro-vs-jobber)
6. **Jobber's real cost is $300+/mo** — Core $39/mo sounds cheap but extra users ($29/mo each), AI Receptionist ($99/mo), Marketing Suite ($79/mo), and payment processing push costs to $300-500+/mo for a real business — [MyQuoteIQ](https://myquoteiq.com/jobber-pricing-breakdown-2026/)
7. **Jobber QuickBooks sync breaks** — "integration with QuickBooks is prone to sync errors" — consistent complaint across review platforms — [BuildBite](https://buildbite.com/insights/jobber-vs-housecall-pro)
8. **Housecall Pro invoicing limitations** — "late fees cannot be set up automatically and invoice corrections require starting over" — [FieldPulse](https://www.fieldpulse.com/resources/blog/housecall-pro-vs-jobber)
9. **Feature gating across all platforms** — QuickBooks integration, advanced reporting, and key features locked behind $149+/mo plans. Solo contractors on $39-79/mo plans get stripped-down versions — [Housecall Pro Pricing](https://www.housecallpro.com/pricing/), [Jobber Pricing](https://www.getjobber.com/pricing/)
10. **28% of small service businesses** face implementation challenges due to limited IT resources and training costs — [Mordor Intelligence](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/field-service-management-market)

### Identified Gap

- **What's missing**: A dead-simple, affordable ($29-59/mo flat) field service tool purpose-built for the solo contractor or 1-5 person crew that includes scheduling, dispatching, estimates/invoicing, customer CRM, native QuickBooks sync, two-way SMS, and mobile payments — without the 6-week onboarding or $150+/mo price tag. No feature gating, no per-user fees.
- **Who needs it**: Solo HVAC techs, 2-person plumbing shops, independent electricians, pest control operators, and handymen. These operators currently sit in a dead zone: ServiceTitan is too expensive and complex, Housecall Pro Basic is crippled (1 user, no QuickBooks), and Jobber's real cost balloons past $300/mo.
- **Why competitors don't do it**: ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, and Jobber are all VC-funded and optimizing for higher ARPU by moving upmarket. They intentionally gate critical features (QuickBooks sync, advanced scheduling, reporting) behind expensive tiers to force upgrades. Serving solo contractors at $39/mo doesn't move the needle for their growth metrics.
- **Current workaround**: Google Calendar for scheduling, phone calls/texts for dispatch, paper invoices or QuickBooks invoicing (disconnected from job management), Venmo/Zelle for payments, spreadsheets for customer tracking.

### Our Opportunity

- **Product concept**: "Jobber Lite" — a mobile-first field service app for solo contractors and tiny crews (1-5 people) that does scheduling, dispatching, estimates, invoicing, payments, customer CRM, and QuickBooks sync. All features included at every tier. No per-user fees. 10-minute setup, not 10-week onboarding.
- **Key differentiator**: All core features (including QuickBooks sync and two-way SMS) available from day one at a flat $39-59/mo — no feature gating, no per-user fees, no contracts. Built for the person who is both the owner, dispatcher, and technician. "The anti-ServiceTitan."
- **LTD price point**: $199-$349 one-time (replaces $150-300+/mo subscriptions — payback in 1-2 months)
- **Target channels**: r/HVAC, r/plumbing, r/electricians, r/pestcontrol, r/Handyman, r/smallbusiness, r/sweatystartup, HVAC-Talk forums, Plumbing Zone forums, trade school alumni networks, local trade associations (PHCC, ACCA, NATE), Facebook groups (HVAC Technicians, Plumbers United, Electricians Network)
- **AppSumo potential**: Yes — excellent. ServiceTitan's $1,000+/mo pricing and Jobber's $300+/mo real cost create massive perceived value for an LTD. The "still using paper" segment is enormous, and tradespeople are active AppSumo buyers for business tools.

## Dental Practice Management: Affordable Cloud Software for Solo & Small Practices

### Market Landscape

Dentrix and Eaglesoft have dominated dental practice management for decades, but both are expensive, Windows-only legacy systems with outdated UIs. Open Dental emerged as the affordable alternative but still requires a learning curve. The market is ripe for a modern, cloud-native solution aimed at solo dentists and small (1-3 chair) practices who are overpaying for bloated software or stuck on paper.

| Competitor | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Dentrix (Henry Schein) | ~$139/mo + additional fees | Most comprehensive feature set, dominant market share, deep reporting, robust insurance/billing | 32% more expensive than category average (G2), Windows-only, slow performance, combining insurances is "a big hassle," steep learning curve |
| Eaglesoft (Patterson) | ~$349/mo (incl. training/support) | Familiar interface for long-time users, decent training programs, structured workflows | Very expensive for small practices, outdated UI, "feels outdated compared to modern alternatives," slow and prone to crashes, steep learning curve for new staff |
| Open Dental | $179/mo first year → $129/mo after | 41% less expensive than average (G2), highly customizable, open-source foundation, strong community, great for multi-location | Still requires server or cloud hosting setup, learning curve for customization, less polished UI than modern cloud apps, not truly cloud-native out of the box |
| CareStack | Custom pricing (~$300+/mo) | True cloud-native, all-in-one (PMS + imaging + patient engagement), market leader award (Winter 2026), modern UI | Expensive, complex for solo practices, implementation can be time-consuming, enterprise-focused |
| Dentrix Ascend (Henry Schein) | Custom pricing (~$400+/mo) | Cloud version of Dentrix, familiar brand, scalable | Even more expensive than Dentrix, still maturing feature-wise compared to legacy Dentrix |
| Planet DDS (Denticon/Apteryx) | Custom pricing | Cloud-based, strong for DSOs and multi-location, imaging integration | Enterprise/DSO focus, not built for solo practices, opaque pricing |
| Curve Dental | ~$350-500/mo | True cloud, intuitive interface, no server required, good imaging integration | Expensive for solo practices, fewer third-party integrations than Dentrix |
| tab32 | Custom pricing | Cloud-native, AI features, tele-dentistry, strong patient engagement | Newer entrant, smaller user base, pricing not transparent |
| DentiMax | ~$139/mo | Affordable, user-friendly, includes imaging, good for small practices | Smaller ecosystem, fewer integrations, less comprehensive reporting |
| Adit (practice management + marketing) | Custom pricing | Modern UI, patient communication tools, online booking, combined PMS + marketing | Still growing, less established than legacy players, complex pricing |

### Top Customer Complaints (from reviews)

1. **Dentrix is 32% more expensive than category average** — and comes with additional fees for training, support, and add-on modules beyond the base price — [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/dentrix/reviews), [RevUp Dental](https://revupdental.com/best-dental-practice-management-systems/)
2. **Eaglesoft at $349/mo is prohibitive for small practices** — "upfront costs, ongoing maintenance fees, and additional charges for training and support can strain budgets" — [Titan Web Agency](https://blog.titanwebagency.com/dental-management-software-reviews)
3. **Dentrix is Windows-only** — no Mac support, no true cloud option (Dentrix Ascend is separate and more expensive), limiting for modern practices — [Aegis IT](https://thinkaegis.com/best-dental-software/)
4. **Eaglesoft UI is outdated** — "user interface feels outdated compared to more modern alternatives and can lead to a steeper learning curve for new staff" — [Titan Web Agency](https://blog.titanwebagency.com/dental-management-software-reviews)
5. **Both Dentrix and Eaglesoft are slow** — performance complaints are consistent across review platforms; "software is typically slower than others" (Dentrix), "slow and occasionally prone to crashes" (Eaglesoft) — [Aegis IT](https://thinkaegis.com/best-dental-software/)
6. **Hidden fees are common** — "hidden fees, poor support, clunky workflows, and 'works for everyone' claims that rarely deliver" are common pitfalls — [RevUp Dental](https://revupdental.com/best-dental-practice-management-systems/)
7. **Insurance/billing complexity** — Dentrix users report "combining insurances can be a big hassle" — [Aegis IT](https://thinkaegis.com/best-dental-software/)
8. **Open Dental requires technical setup** — while affordable, it's not cloud-native out of the box and requires server management or third-party cloud hosting — [Software Finder](https://softwarefinder.com/emr-software/open-dental)
9. **Cloud solutions are all enterprise-priced** — CareStack, Dentrix Ascend, Planet DDS, and Curve Dental all target multi-location practices at $300-500+/mo, leaving solo dentists with no modern cloud option in their budget — [CertifyHealth](https://www.certifyhealth.com/blog/top-10-dental-practice-management-software-2026/)
10. **Data migration pain** — switching between systems is painful and expensive, creating vendor lock-in that legacy players exploit with price increases — [Zuub](https://zuub.com/blog/practice-management-software/dentrix-vs-eaglesoft-software-comparison/)

### Identified Gap

- **What's missing**: A modern, truly cloud-native dental practice management system priced at **$99-149/mo** for solo and small practices (1-3 chairs) — sitting between Open Dental's affordability but technical complexity and the enterprise cloud solutions' $300-500+/mo pricing. Should include scheduling, patient records, insurance billing, imaging integration, patient communication (SMS/email), and online booking — all in a clean, modern UI with no server to manage.
- **Who needs it**: Solo dentists and small practices (1-3 operatories) who are either overpaying for Dentrix/Eaglesoft, struggling with Open Dental's technical requirements, or still using paper charts. There are approximately 200,000 dental practices in the US, with a significant portion being solo or small practices.
- **Why competitors don't do it**: Legacy players (Dentrix, Eaglesoft) profit from their installed base and have no incentive to offer cheaper cloud alternatives that would cannibalize revenue. Cloud-native entrants (CareStack, Planet DDS) target DSOs and multi-location practices for higher ARPU. Open Dental is community-driven with limited resources for UX modernization.
- **Current workaround**: Overpaying for Dentrix/Eaglesoft, running Open Dental with DIY server management, or (in some small practices) still using paper charts and manual billing.

### Our Opportunity

- **Product concept**: Cloud-native dental practice management for solo/small practices — scheduling, patient records, charting, insurance billing, imaging integration, two-way patient SMS, online booking, and basic reporting. Zero server setup, works on any device (Mac, PC, tablet).
- **Key differentiator**: Cloud-native at Open Dental's price point ($99-149/mo) with Curve Dental's modern UX. No Windows requirement, no server to manage, no 6-month implementation. "Open Dental's affordability meets modern cloud simplicity."
- **LTD price point**: $499-$799 one-time (replaces $139-349/mo subscriptions — payback in 3-6 months). Higher LTD price justified by healthcare/compliance requirements and higher customer willingness to pay.
- **Target channels**: r/dentistry, r/DentalSchool, Dentaltown forums, Facebook groups (Dental Nachos, The Dental Entrepreneur), ADA (American Dental Association) trade shows, state dental association newsletters, dental school alumni networks, dental supply reps
- **AppSumo potential**: Maybe — dental software has higher compliance requirements (HIPAA) which may limit AppSumo's typical audience. Better suited for a targeted launch through dental communities like Dentaltown. However, the pricing gap is massive and a well-positioned LTD could gain traction.

## Veterinary Practice Management: Modern Cloud PMS for Small/Independent Vet Clinics

### Market Landscape

The veterinary practice management software (PIMS) market is dominated by IDEXX (Cornerstone, Neo) and Covetrus (Avimark), both legacy players with expensive, often server-dependent systems. Newer cloud entrants like Shepherd, Digitail, and NaVetor are emerging but haven't achieved mainstream adoption. Small independent clinics (1-3 veterinarians) are caught between expensive legacy systems and immature newcomers.

| Competitor | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Cornerstone (IDEXX) | ~$420-549/mo + server/maintenance fees | Industry standard, deep clinical features, lab integration (IDEXX), large installed base | "Horrible to navigate," "very outdated," "constantly freezes," requires physical server, expensive, can't access from home, poor syncing with non-IDEXX data |
| Avimark (Covetrus) | Custom pricing (~$200-400+/mo) | Widely used, stable, good veterinary workflow focus, lower initial investment than Cornerstone | Tiered pricing gets expensive for larger clinics, legacy interface, Covetrus acquisition created uncertainty |
| IDEXX Neo | Custom pricing | Modern cloud UI from IDEXX, built-in IDEXX lab integration, designed for small-mid practices | Still tied to IDEXX ecosystem, pricing not transparent, newer product with evolving features |
| eVetPractice | ~$179-300/mo | Cloud-based, good for small practices, iPad-friendly, includes basic features | Limited advanced features, smaller ecosystem, less comprehensive than legacy players |
| Shepherd | ~$140/mo (1-2 users) - $500/mo (31+ users) | AI-powered, modern cloud-native, smart charting, automated reminders, growing fast | Newer entrant, some users report glitches and bugs, implementation can be time-consuming |
| Digitail | Custom pricing | All-in-one cloud platform, AI features, client engagement tools, modern design | Pricing not transparent, still building market share, fewer integrations than established players |
| NaVetor (Patterson) | ~$119-199/mo | Cloud-based, affordable, Patterson backing, includes PMS + client communication | Patterson's track record with Eaglesoft creates skepticism, limited advanced features |
| VETport | Custom pricing | Cloud-based, comprehensive PMS, telemedicine integration, good for multi-location | Less well-known, UI less polished than newest entrants, pricing requires quote |
| DaySmart Vet (formerly 123Pet) | ~$139-299/mo | User-friendly, good for small practices, scheduling and client management | Originally pet grooming software — less deep veterinary features, limited lab integrations |
| Hippo Manager | ~$119/mo starting | Cloud-native, HIPAA-like security, intuitive UI, good customer service, affordable entry | Smaller company, fewer integrations, less comprehensive than Cornerstone/Avimark for complex cases |

### Top Customer Complaints (from reviews)

1. **Cornerstone is expensive and requires a physical server** — "$420-549/mo plus server maintenance, implementation fees, and staff training costs" — and the server "is very large and crashes sometimes" — [NectarVet](https://www.nectarvet.com/post/cornerstone-vet-software-pricing-reviews), [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/99976/Cornerstone-Practice-Management/reviews/)
2. **Cornerstone is "horrible to navigate" and "very outdated"** — users describe it as constantly freezing and crashing, with an interface that hasn't been meaningfully updated in years — [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/99976/Cornerstone-Practice-Management/reviews/)
3. **Can't access Cornerstone from home** — server-based architecture means no remote access without complex VPN setup, a major pain point during and after COVID — [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/99976/Cornerstone-Practice-Management/reviews/)
4. **Cost is the #1 barrier for small clinics** — "if there was a way to get all of the software for a smaller cost, we would not have switched" — small independent clinics feel trapped between expensive legacy systems and immature alternatives — [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/99976/Cornerstone-Practice-Management/reviews/)
5. **Newer cloud solutions have glitches** — users of newer platforms report "frequent glitches and system bugs that can bog down performance" and issues with data migration from legacy systems — [Cherry](https://withcherry.com/blog/veterinary-practice-management-software)
6. **Reminder systems are difficult to use** — across multiple platforms, "reminder systems can be difficult to use and the program lacks substantial reporting capabilities" — [Software Advice](https://www.softwareadvice.com/veterinary/)
7. **IDEXX ecosystem lock-in** — Cornerstone integrates best with IDEXX labs, creating switching costs; non-IDEXX lab results don't sync as cleanly — [NectarVet](https://www.nectarvet.com/post/cornerstone-vet-software-pricing-reviews)
8. **Data migration is painful and expensive** — switching from legacy systems requires significant time and money, creating vendor lock-in — [Cherry](https://withcherry.com/blog/veterinary-practice-management-software)
9. **Avimark/Covetrus uncertainty** — Covetrus acquisition and subsequent changes have created uncertainty for long-time Avimark users about the product's future direction — [VETport](https://www.vetport.com/avimark-vs-cornerstone-vs-vetport)
10. **Advanced features require additional charges** — across all platforms, lab integrations, imaging, telemedicine, and advanced reporting often come as expensive add-ons — [NectarVet](https://www.nectarvet.com/post/best-cloud-based-vet-software-prices-reviews)

### Identified Gap

- **What's missing**: A modern, cloud-native veterinary PMS at **$99-159/mo flat** for small independent clinics (1-3 vets) that includes clinical records, scheduling, client communication (SMS/email), lab integration (not locked to one vendor), inventory management, invoicing, and basic reporting — all in a clean, modern UI with no server to manage and no per-user fees.
- **Who needs it**: Small independent veterinary clinics (1-3 veterinarians, 3-10 staff) — which represent the majority of the ~33,000 vet practices in the US. Many are stuck on expensive Cornerstone/Avimark installations with outdated UIs, or are hesitant to switch to newer cloud options due to maturity concerns.
- **Why competitors don't do it**: IDEXX and Covetrus profit from their installed base and ecosystem lock-in (especially lab integrations). Newer cloud entrants are venture-funded and targeting growth/enterprise segments. The small independent clinic at $99-159/mo doesn't generate enough ARPU for VC-backed companies.
- **Current workaround**: Overpaying for Cornerstone/Avimark with outdated interfaces, using ancient server hardware, or (for very small/new practices) cobbling together generic tools like Google Calendar + spreadsheets + manual record-keeping.

### Our Opportunity

- **Product concept**: Cloud-native veterinary PMS for small independent clinics — patient records, scheduling, client communication (two-way SMS), multi-vendor lab integration, inventory management, invoicing/payments, prescription management, and basic reporting. Works on any device, no server required.
- **Key differentiator**: Lab-vendor-agnostic integration (not locked to IDEXX or any single provider), modern cloud UI at legacy pricing ($99-159/mo flat), no per-user fees, no server to manage. "Cornerstone features, cloud simplicity, Open Dental pricing."
- **LTD price point**: $599-$899 one-time (replaces $420-549/mo Cornerstone subscriptions + server costs — payback in 1-2 months). Higher LTD justified by professional/clinical use case and high switching costs that create retention.
- **Target channels**: r/veterinary, r/VetTech, Veterinary Information Network (VIN) forums, Facebook groups (Veterinary Practice Managers, Not One More Vet), AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association) events, state veterinary association newsletters, veterinary conferences (VMX, WVC), veterinary supply reps
- **AppSumo potential**: Unlikely — veterinary software has clinical/compliance requirements and a more professional buyer persona. Better suited for targeted launch through VIN forums, veterinary Facebook groups, and industry trade shows. However, the Cornerstone pricing gap is so massive that a well-positioned LTD through direct channels could be very compelling.

## Cross-Category Patterns

Across all three boring-business categories analyzed today, the same systemic patterns emerge:

1. **Enterprise software sold to small businesses** — In every category, the market leaders (ServiceTitan, Dentrix/Eaglesoft, Cornerstone/Avimark) were built for large operations and charge accordingly ($250-2,500/mo). Small operators are forced to overpay for features they'll never use.

2. **The "dead zone" in pricing** — A consistent gap exists between free/basic tools ($0-60/mo) and full-featured professional software ($250-500+/mo). The $80-150/mo range is dramatically underserved — this is where most small operators would comfortably pay.

3. **Legacy software with 2005-era UIs** — Dentrix, Eaglesoft, Cornerstone, Avimark, and Mitchell 1 all have interfaces that look and feel dated. Users tolerate them because switching costs are high, not because they're satisfied.

4. **Server-dependent architecture** — Both dental and veterinary legacy leaders still require on-premise servers, creating cost, maintenance, and remote access headaches. Cloud-native alternatives exist but are priced for enterprise.

5. **Ecosystem lock-in** — IDEXX locks vet clinics into their lab ecosystem through Cornerstone. Henry Schein and Patterson leverage their supply chains to push Dentrix and Eaglesoft. Breaking vendor lock-in (especially for lab/supply integrations) is a major differentiator.

6. **Feature gating is the universal complaint** — Every category's "affordable" tier strips out essential features (QuickBooks sync, advanced scheduling, reporting, SMS) to force upgrades. Flat-rate, all-features-included pricing is a powerful differentiator.

7. **Support quality is in freefall** — ServiceTitan's "TERRIBLE" support, Housecall Pro's buried phone number, Cornerstone's freezing issues — across every category, support quality is declining as companies scale. Human, responsive support is now a competitive moat.

8. **Massive "still on paper" segments** — 28%+ of small field service businesses, significant portions of solo dental practices, and many small vet clinics are still on paper/spreadsheets because existing software is too expensive, too complex, or both. These are greenfield customers.

9. **Healthcare categories (dental/vet) have higher willingness to pay** — While field service contractors are extremely price-sensitive, dental and veterinary practices have higher margins and will pay $100-150/mo for the right solution. LTDs can be priced higher ($499-899) with strong conversion.

10. **Switching costs create both barriers and opportunities** — Data migration is painful in all three categories, which creates vendor lock-in for incumbents. But it also means that once you win a customer, they're extremely sticky. Offering free data migration from legacy systems is a powerful acquisition tool.
