## 1. Micasa — House Maintenance Tracking from the Terminal
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47075124
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Show HN
- **Engagement**: 621 points, 197 comments (2 days ago!)
- **Revenue Data**: Open source, no revenue yet
- **Boring Business Score**: 4/5
- **Target Industry**: Homeowners / property management
- **Core Value Prop**: Track home maintenance, repairs, and systems (HVAC, plumbing, roof) from a terminal tool. Know when things were last serviced, what needs attention.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: This is a developer tool (terminal-based). The massive engagement (621 pts!) proves the problem resonates, but the solution is too technical for normal homeowners. A web/mobile version targeting landlords and property managers would be the commercial opportunity.
- **Our Angle**: Build a non-technical version: "Home/Property Maintenance Tracker" — web + mobile app for landlords managing 1-50 properties. Track equipment ages, schedule maintenance, log repairs with photos, get alerts. Integrates with property management workflow.
- **LTD Potential**: 4/5 — Property managers would pay $79-149 LTD for this. Much cheaper than full property management software.

## 2. Phoenix/Vue Side Project — $2.5K/mo Revenue
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26855726

- **Engagement**: 381 points, 89 comments
- **Revenue Data**: $2,500/mo after 2 years

- **Gap/Opportunity**: Demonstrates the bootstrapped boring-business model works. Key lesson: 2 years to $2.5K/mo — patience required but compound growth is real.
- **Our Angle**: Validates the LTD-to-MRR playbook. Build, launch on AppSumo for initial traction, then convert to recurring.
- **LTD Potential**: 3/5

## 3. Modern Palletization App (Logistics)
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40804294
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Show HN
- **Engagement**: 153 points, 42 comments
- **Revenue Data**: Not disclosed
- **Boring Business Score**: 5/5
- **Target Industry**: Logistics / warehousing / shipping

- **Our Angle**: "Pallet Planning SaaS" — team accounts, saved product dimensions library, export to shipping labels, API for e-commerce integration. Target small 3PL companies and warehouses.
- **LTD Potential**: 4/5 — Logistics companies have real budgets and this solves a daily operational problem.

## 4. "Boring Business" for Hackers — Ask HN Discussion
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38882314
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Ask HN
- **Engagement**: High engagement (Jan 2024)
- **Revenue Data**: Various examples shared in thread
- **Boring Business Score**: 5/5
- **Target Industry**: Cross-vertical validation
- **Core Value Prop**: HN community discussing what "boring businesses" hackers should build. Key suggestions: domain registrar, vertical SaaS for trades, IT asset management, compliance tools. Validates the boring business thesis from the technical community's perspective.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Ideas mentioned include: niche registrar services, industry-specific compliance tools, equipment maintenance tracking, and service business scheduling. All are unglamorous but have long-term passive revenue potential.
- **Our Angle**: Cross-reference with Reddit findings. The HN community validates the same opportunities: trades software, property management, compliance tracking.
- **LTD Potential**: 4/5

## 5. Vertical SaaS CTO Experiences
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46271523
- **Additional Links**:
  - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45437044
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Discussion
- **Engagement**: Active discussion threads
- **Revenue Data**: Not disclosed, but implies significant revenue
- **Boring Business Score**: 4/5
- **Target Industry**: Vertical SaaS (generic)
- **Core Value Prop**: Two CTOs sharing experiences at vertical SaaS companies. Key insight: "paired with a product-focused CEO with deep domain expertise" — domain expertise is the moat, not technology. "He came in with a thesis as to why our target customer was completely unsuited to their needs" — understanding the customer deeply matters more than tech.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Reinforces that boring vertical SaaS works when you have domain expertise. The CEO with deep domain knowledge + CTO partnership model is proven.
- **Our Angle**: Partner with domain experts in boring industries (ex-plumber, ex-property manager) for customer insights and distribution.
- **LTD Potential**: N/A — strategic insight

## 6. How to Raise $600K for Boring Software
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37346497
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Ask HN
- **Engagement**: Active discussion (Sept 2023)
- **Revenue Data**: Pre-revenue discussion
- **Boring Business Score**: 4/5
- **Target Industry**: Boring business software (generic)
- **Core Value Prop**: Developer wanting to write "boring business software with boring tech" and raise $600K. Discussion covers funding options for non-VC-track boring SaaS: revenue-based financing, SBA loans, indie.vc model, self-funding with consulting.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Validates that there's demand for boring business software AND that bootstrapping/alternative funding works better than VC for these businesses.
- **Our Angle**: LTD model (AppSumo) as an alternative to raising capital. Fund development with early adopter LTD sales.
- **LTD Potential**: N/A — strategic validation

## 7. AI Agents Eating SaaS — Vertical SaaS Exception
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268452
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Discussion
- **Engagement**: Active discussion (Dec 2025)
- **Revenue Data**: N/A
- **Boring Business Score**: 4/5
- **Target Industry**: Vertical SaaS
- **Core Value Prop**: Key quote: "For deep vertical SaaS, the threat model is different: it's other funded startups or internal enterprise clones (both of which we've already faced and won against)." — AI agents are disrupting horizontal SaaS but vertical/boring SaaS is more defensible because domain knowledge is the moat.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Boring business vertical SaaS is AI-resistant because it requires deep industry-specific workflows, compliance knowledge, and customer relationships that AI can't easily replicate.
- **Our Angle**: Build vertical SaaS with deep industry-specific features. AI agents can't easily replace "plumbing dispatching software that knows EPA compliance rules." The moat is domain specificity.
- **LTD Potential**: N/A — strategic validation

## 8. Simple IT Asset Management (Show HN)
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8675459
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Show HN
- **Engagement**: Historical thread
- **Revenue Data**: N/A
- **Boring Business Score**: 4/5
- **Target Industry**: IT services / MSPs / small business IT
- **Core Value Prop**: Simple IT asset management tool. Comment mentions: "Tamit is a several million piece of crap asset and po management system" — indicating legacy tools are terrible and there's room for simple alternatives.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: IT asset management for small businesses (not enterprise). Track computers, licenses, warranties, and equipment. Legacy tools are overpriced and overengineered.
- **Our Angle**: Simple, modern IT asset tracker for small businesses and MSPs: hardware inventory, software licenses, warranty tracking, and equipment lifecycle management. No enterprise bloat.
- **LTD Potential**: 4/5 — MSPs would buy a $79-129 LTD immediately.

## 9. Indie Hackers — Boring SaaS Revenue Milestones
- **Source**: https://www.indiehackers.com (various posts and milestone threads)
- **Platform**: Indie Hackers
- **Type**: Revenue milestones
- **Engagement**: Various
- **Revenue Data**: Multiple examples:
  - **Carrd** (simple landing pages): $1M+ ARR — boring, simple, works
  - **Plausible** (analytics): $100K+ ARR — simple alternative to Google Analytics
  - **Transistor.fm** (podcast hosting): $50K+ MRR — boring infrastructure
  - **Tuple** (pair programming): $50K+ MRR — niche developer tool
  - Various cleaning/trades SaaS tools reaching $5-20K MRR
- **Boring Business Score**: 4/5
- **Target Industry**: Cross-vertical
- **Core Value Prop**: Pattern from IH revenue milestones: the most successful indie products solve ONE problem really well for a specific audience. Not "AI-powered everything" but "simple invoicing for freelancers" or "scheduling for dog groomers."
- **Gap/Opportunity**: The IH community consistently validates that focused, boring tools outperform ambitious platforms. Key factors: simple pricing, clear value prop, strong SEO/content marketing.
- **Our Angle**: Pick ONE boring industry, solve ONE core problem, price simply. The LTD-to-MRR playbook is well-proven on IH.
- **LTD Potential**: 4/5

## 10. Field Service Scheduling & Dispatch
- **Source**: Multiple HN and IH discussions
- **Additional Links**:
  - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38882314
- **Platform**: HN / Indie Hackers
- **Type**: Recurring demand signal
- **Engagement**: Mentioned across multiple threads
- **Revenue Data**: ServiceTitan ($500M+ revenue), Jobber ($100M+ ARR), Housecall Pro (acquired for $585M) — validates massive TAM
- **Boring Business Score**: 5/5
- **Target Industry**: Field service (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, cleaning, pest control)
- **Core Value Prop**: Scheduling, dispatching, and invoicing for field service businesses. The big players (ServiceTitan, Jobber) have moved upmarket, leaving a gap for simple, affordable tools for 1-10 truck operations.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: ServiceTitan's $585M Housecall Pro acquisition proves market size. But both are now targeting bigger customers. Solo operators and small crews are underserved with affordable, simple tools.
- **Our Angle**: "Anti-ServiceTitan" — no per-tech fees, no $2K setup, no annual contracts. Simple flat pricing. Mobile-first dispatching + invoicing. Target the 80% of field service businesses with 1-5 trucks.
- **LTD Potential**: 5/5 — This is the #1 LTD opportunity. $89-149 undercuts $200-500/mo competitors.

## 11. Equipment & Maintenance Tracking for Trades
- **Source**: HN discussions and IH posts
- **Platform**: HN / Indie Hackers
- **Type**: Emerging demand
- **Engagement**: Moderate — mentioned in boring business and vertical SaaS threads
- **Revenue Data**: N/A
- **Boring Business Score**: 5/5
- **Target Industry**: Trades with expensive equipment (HVAC, plumbing, construction, landscaping)
- **Core Value Prop**: Track equipment maintenance schedules, warranty expiration, service history, and replacement planning. Prevent costly breakdowns and maintain compliance (EPA certifications, OSHA requirements).
- **Gap/Opportunity**: Most trades businesses track equipment on paper or not at all. When a $40K HVAC unit breaks down because maintenance was missed, the cost is enormous. Simple tracking prevents this.
- **Our Angle**: Equipment lifecycle management for trades: maintenance reminders, service logs, warranty tracking, compliance cert expiration alerts. Per-equipment pricing or flat rate.
- **LTD Potential**: 4/5 — $79-99 LTD. Equipment is expensive; preventing one breakdown pays for the tool.

## 12. "Why We're Building a Boring Business" — HN Classic
- **Source**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2755215
- **Platform**: HN
- **Type**: Discussion / Essay
- **Engagement**: Classic HN discussion (2011, still referenced)
- **Revenue Data**: N/A
- **Boring Business Score**: 5/5 (meta)
- **Target Industry**: Philosophy / validation
- **Core Value Prop**: The OG "boring business" thesis on HN: "A boring business will surely not keep you working as late or as hard." But the counterpoint: boring businesses provide stability, predictable revenue, and better quality of life. This 2011 post set the stage for the entire "boring business" movement.
- **Gap/Opportunity**: The boring business movement has only accelerated since 2011. With AI making development faster, the gap between "idea" and "MVP" is shrinking — making it more viable than ever to build vertical SaaS for boring industries.
- **Our Angle**: We're building at the perfect time: AI-assisted development + proven boring business thesis + massive underserved markets.
- **LTD Potential**: N/A — foundational philosophy
