### 1. Field Service Management for Solo/Micro Trades — Score: 102/105

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | ServiceTitan $772M ARR, Jobber 250K+ users, HCP 200K+ users. $5.49B market. Proven demand at scale. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Per-user pricing, add-on creep, no offline, terrible Android apps. ST explicitly abandons <3 tech shops. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $79 LTD replaces $468-$4,740 in 5-year subscription costs. Zero FSM LTDs exist. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Kickserv/ServiceM8 have limited free tiers but core features gated. People will pay. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | r/HVAC, r/Plumbing, r/electricians, HVAC-Talk, trade Facebook groups. Massive accessible communities. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "ServiceTitan alternative", "best HVAC software", competitor comparison pages. High-volume keywords. |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Zero FSM tools on AppSumo. Uncontested category. 3.5M home service businesses, 94% small. |
| Review Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | Trade businesses actively review software on Capterra/G2. High engagement. |
| MRR Path | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | AI dispatching, advanced reporting, marketing tools, per-user for growing teams. Clear upsell. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Scheduling + CRM + invoicing + payments in 4-6 weeks. QuickBooks integration adds complexity. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | HVAC, plumbing, pest control = deeply boring trades. Perfect 5/5. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Boring Business Fit**: VCs ignore small trades. Customers non-technical. Software outdated AND overpriced. Real budgets. Low churn.
**Team Fit**: Standard CRUD + calendar + payments. No exotic domain knowledge required.

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**:
1. Build MVP: quote > schedule > invoice > get-paid pipeline. Mobile-first, offline-capable.
2. Launch on AppSumo at $79 LTD — first mover in uncontested category.
3. Seed r/HVAC, r/Plumbing, r/electricians with beta invites.
4. Target "ServiceTitan alternative for small businesses" SEO from day one.

**Risks**:
1. Jobber/HCP could launch stripped-down tiers to compete on price.
2. QuickBooks integration complexity could delay launch.
3. Trade-specific pricebook data needed for each vertical (HVAC vs. plumbing vs. electrical).

### 2. Cleaning Service Management — Score: 97/105

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | $1.98B market, ZenMaid, Swept, MaidCentral all profitable. Onedesk hit $100K+ MRR in 10 months. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | ZenMaid per-seat ($24/seat!), buggy apps, no payroll. BookingKoala DOWN 2 weeks. Feature gating everywhere. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $79 LTD, flat-rate unlimited users (up to 10-15). Low infrastructure costs. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | BookingKoala has free tier. Connecteam free for <10. Some free alternatives exist. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | r/EntrepreneurRideAlong (cleaning niche is huge), r/CleaningBusiness, Facebook groups (100K+), ISSA. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "Best cleaning business software 2026". Active content space with many comparison articles. |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Cleaning is one of the most popular "first business" categories. Huge AppSumo-ready audience. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Active review community. ZenMaid has hundreds of reviews showing engaged user base. |

| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Scheduling + invoicing + team chat + checklists + photo proof. Achievable in 4-6 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Cleaning = deeply boring. Perfect fit for boring business thesis. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Boring Business Fit**: VCs ignore cleaning micro-businesses. Non-technical users. Per-seat pricing is hated. Real budgets ($100-500/mo software spend). Low churn (cleaning businesses are loyal).
**Team Fit**: Standard patterns. Bilingual (English/Spanish) from day one is a differentiator.

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**:
1. Build mobile-first scheduling + invoicing + team messaging + cleaning checklists.
2. Launch on AppSumo at $79 LTD. Position as "ZenMaid without per-seat fees."
3. Target r/EntrepreneurRideAlong — the cleaning business subreddit.
4. Include free solo tier as acquisition funnel, monetize at 2+ cleaners.

**Risks**:
1. ZenMaid has strong community loyalty (3,000+ owners).
2. Per-seat pricing is profitable — flat-rate may require volume to compensate.
3. 200%+ annual employee turnover in cleaning makes team management a revolving door.

### 3. Landscaping & Lawn Care Business OS — Score: 93/105

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | 600K+ landscaping businesses, $130B industry. Yardbook, SingleOps, Service Autopilot have paying customers. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Jobber is generic. Copilot CRM "fairly buggy mess." LawnPro has outages. Gap between generic and enterprise. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $79-99 LTD. Simple scheduling + CRM + invoicing. Low infrastructure costs. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Yardbook is free (dated UI). Jobber has $39/mo entry. Some free options exist. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | r/lawncare (500K+), r/landscaping, LawnSite.com, trade Facebook groups. Excellent reach. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "Best lawn care software", seasonal content, competitor comparisons. High volume. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Good fit. Seasonal buying pattern is a lever — launch Feb-Mar for maximum conversion. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Active review community on Capterra/G2. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Chemical tracking premium, route optimization, crew management for larger teams, snow removal add-on. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Scheduling + CRM + invoicing + route optimization. Achievable in 4-6 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Lawn care / landscaping = deeply boring trades. Perfect fit. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Boring Business Fit**: VCs don't fund lawn care software. Non-technical operators. Existing tools are generic or overpriced. Seasonal lock-in reduces churn.
**Team Fit**: Standard CRUD + mapping/routing. Chemical tracking adds niche value.

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**:
1. Build lawn-care-specific CRM with satellite-based property measurement, seasonal service scheduling, and chemical application tracking.
2. Launch before spring season (Feb-Mar) for maximum conversion window.
3. Seed LawnSite.com forums and r/lawncare with beta invites.
4. Include snow removal module for year-round revenue in northern markets.

**Risks**:
1. Seasonal revenue — spring/summer heavy, winter slow (mitigate with snow removal features).
2. Yardbook's free tier is a barrier to entry (compete on mobile-first UX and lawn-specific features).
3. Service Autopilot has loyal power users who may resist switching.

### 4. Property Management for Small Landlords — Score: 91/105

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | $5.88B market, 9.7M landlords. AppFolio, Buildium, DoorLoop all proven. 80% self-manage. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | AppFolio requires 50+ units. Per-unit pricing punishes small portfolios. Hidden fees, payment disasters ($6,750 diverted). |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $99 LTD works but payment processing (Stripe/Plaid) has ongoing costs to manage. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | TurboTenant, Avail, Innago, Stessa all free. Harder to justify day-1 payment without clear differentiation. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | BiggerPockets (the #1 landlord community), r/landlord, r/realestateinvesting, REIA chapters. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "Buildium alternative", "property management software for small landlords". Massive content opportunity. |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Landlords are deal-hunters by nature. Clear ROI story: "$99 one-time vs. $500+/yr accountant." |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Landlords leave reviews on BiggerPockets, G2, Capterra. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Per-transaction ACH fees, premium AI features, multi-LLC management, tenant screening. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Rent collection + lease + maintenance + accounting. State-specific compliance varies. Tight for 4-6 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Property management is unglamorous professional service. Not blue-collar trades but solidly boring. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Boring Business Fit**: VCs chase 100+ unit operators. 40%+ of small landlords still on spreadsheets. Real budgets. Very low churn (landlords don't switch software mid-lease).
**Team Fit**: Requires Plaid/Stripe expertise for payments, e-signature APIs, state-specific legal templates. Designer scope is medium-high.

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**:
1. Build "Goldilocks" tool: rent collection + Schedule E automation + maintenance + lease management.
2. Launch on AppSumo at $99 LTD. Position: "Replace your spreadsheet in 15 minutes."
3. BiggerPockets forums are THE distribution channel — post detailed comparison content.
4. One-click tax prep with Schedule E export is the killer feature that converts spreadsheet users.

**Risks**:
1. Crowded market with many free tools (TurboTenant, Innago, Stessa). Must differentiate clearly.
2. Payment processing failures are endemic in this market — reliable ACH is table stakes and hard to get right.
3. State-specific legal compliance (eviction laws, deposit rules) requires ongoing maintenance.

### 5. Contractor Bid & AI-Powered Estimation — Score: 89/105

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Handoff AI, QuoteIQ, Estimatic exist with early customers. ConEst at $275+/mo proves willingness to pay. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Current tools $275+/user/mo, commercial-focused. Nothing affordable for residential trades. 73% prioritize estimating. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $69-89 LTD for template-based. AI photo-based may need usage-based pricing overlay. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | No significant free tier for trade-specific estimation tools. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | r/electricians (200K+), r/HVAC, r/Plumbing, r/sweatystartup. Very active estimation discussions. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "AI estimating for contractors", "[trade] quote calculator". High-intent, low-competition keywords. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Contractors would pay $199-$399 once for a tool that saves 5-10 hrs/week on quoting. High perceived value. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Contractors will review tools that win them more jobs. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | AI usage-based pricing, material pricing feeds, advanced templates, multi-trade expansion. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Template-based MVP in 3-4 weeks. AI photo-based adds 2-3 weeks with vision APIs. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Residential trades estimation = deeply boring. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Boring Business Fit**: Category forming now with no dominant player. Non-tech contractors. High willingness to pay for time savings.
**Team Fit**: Vision API + templating + PDF generation. Designer scope: mobile-first estimation UX.

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**:
1. Build single-trade AI estimator first (pressure washing or painting — simplest scope).
2. Photo-based input: snap photo > get quote > email PDF > e-sign > invoice. End-to-end "quote to cash."
3. YouTube demos of photo-to-quote workflow for viral adoption.
4. Launch at $199-$399 LTD — higher price justified by clear time savings.

**Risks**:
1. AI photo estimation accuracy may vary — need trade-specific training data.
2. FSM platforms (Jobber, HCP) could bundle AI estimating, commoditizing the feature.
3. Material cost databases need ongoing maintenance for accuracy.

### 6. Auto Repair Shop Management — Score: 88/105

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | $3.4B market, 303K shops. Tekmetric 13K+ shops, Shopmonkey $110M raised. Massive proven market. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $179+/mo pricing, V2.0 regressions, "customer service is a JOKE," no offline, broken QuickBooks ($10K discrepancy). |
| LTD Viability | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Higher price needed ($499 LTD). More complex product with parts databases, DVI. Harder to sustain profitably. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | ARI has basic free tier but very limited. Most shops will pay for decent software. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | r/MechanicAdvice, r/AutoMechanic, iATN, Diagnostic Network, ASA chapters. Good but more fragmented. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "Tekmetric alternative", "affordable shop management software". High competition but high volume. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Higher price point ($499 LTD) justified by niche value. Narrows audience slightly. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Shop owners are vocal reviewers. Active on Capterra/G2/Diagnostic Network. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Multi-location, parts ordering integrations, marketing tools, advanced reporting. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | RO management, DVI, parts databases, 2-way texting, offline mode. More complex — 6+ weeks realistic. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Auto repair shops = deeply boring trades. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Boring Business Fit**: VC-funded companies chase high ARPU. Legacy players (Mitchell 1/Snap-on) on enterprise contracts. Real budgets ($200-500/mo).
**Team Fit**: DVI requires specialized UX. Parts database integration adds scope. Tight for 4-person team in 6 weeks.

**Verdict**: BUILD (but scope carefully — start with RO + invoicing + texting, add DVI in v2)
**Next Steps**:
1. MVP: digital repair orders, estimates/invoicing, 2-way customer texting, scheduling board.
2. Skip DVI for v1 — add photo-based inspections in v2 after market validation.
3. Position as "the $69/mo Tekmetric alternative" or $499 LTD.
4. Target Diagnostic Network forums — shop owners actively debate software there.

**Risks**:
1. Tekmetric ($179/mo) is well-liked — harder to compete on product quality.
2. Parts database integration (NAPA, AutoZone, O'Reilly) is complex and potentially gatekept.
3. Higher build complexity may push MVP beyond 6 weeks.

### 7. Restaurant Recipe Costing & Menu Profitability — Score: 88/105

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | MarketMan ($239+/mo), xtraCHEF (acquired by Toast). 1M+ restaurants. Proven willingness to pay. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | MarketMan expensive. Toast requires hardware lock-in. No affordable standalone recipe costing tool. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $69-89 LTD. No external API costs. Self-contained calculation tool. Very profitable at scale. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | No significant free tier for recipe costing specifically. Spreadsheets are the competitor. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | r/restaurateur, r/KitchenConfidential (1M+ combined). Good but competitive for attention. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "Restaurant food cost calculator", "recipe costing software", "menu profitability". High intent. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Restaurant owners are price-sensitive. Clear ROI: "Save $500/mo by finding hidden food cost leaks." |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Restaurant owners leave reviews. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | Harder upsell — standalone tool may plateau. Inventory management + POS integration as MRR. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Recipe management, cost calculation, OCR invoice scanning. Simple MVP in 3-4 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Restaurant food cost tracking = deeply boring operations. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Boring Business Fit**: 70% of restaurants are independent/single-location. 3-5% profit margins mean food cost tracking is survival-critical. Real budgets. Low tech sophistication.
**Team Fit**: CRUD + OCR + calculations. Very achievable for 4-person team.

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**:
1. Build standalone recipe costing: input recipes > link to supplier prices > auto-calculate food cost per dish.
2. OCR invoice scanning to auto-update ingredient prices from supplier invoices.
3. Launch at $69-89 LTD. Position: "Know your food cost percentage in real-time, not at month-end."
4. Target r/restaurateur and r/KitchenConfidential for beta users.

**Risks**:
1. Limited MRR path — may stay a one-time-purchase tool.
2. Toast/Square ecosystem lock-in makes some restaurant owners hard to reach.
3. Ingredient price volatility requires frequent data updates.

### 8. Small-Batch Manufacturer Production Management — Score: 87/105

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Craftybase ($50/mo), enterprise ERPs ($10K-50K/yr). Craftplan 577 HN upvotes proves massive demand. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Enterprise ERPs wildly overcomplex. Craftybase is limited. No mid-market hosted option exists. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $79-99 LTD for hosted version. Low infrastructure costs. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Craftplan is open-source but requires self-hosting. Hosted version adds clear value. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | HN (proven 577 upvotes), Etsy seller communities, bakery/brewery forums, Elixir Forum. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "Production management for small manufacturers", "bakery inventory software." Niche but targetable. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Small manufacturers love one-time purchases. Clear value prop. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Smaller, more niche user base. Fewer reviews expected. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | E-commerce integrations (Shopify/Etsy/Square), premium reporting, multi-location, compliance modules. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Recipe/BOM management, inventory, production planning. Well-scoped for 4-6 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Micro-bakeries, soap makers, candle makers = deeply boring small-batch manufacturing. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Boring Business Fit**: VCs don't fund bakery software. Users are artisans, not engineers. Spreadsheets are the current "tool." Real budgets (outgrowing spreadsheets means revenue is there). Very low churn.
**Team Fit**: BOM/recipe management, inventory, batch planning. Standard CRUD patterns.

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**:
1. Build hosted production management: recipe/BOM management with cost rollups, inventory tracking, batch planning, order management.
2. Vertical-specific templates: bakery vs. soap vs. brewery vs. candle workflows.
3. E-commerce integrations (Shopify, Etsy, Square) since most small manufacturers sell online.
4. Launch at $79-99 LTD on AppSumo. Position: "The ERP your micro-bakery can actually afford."

**Risks**:
1. Craftplan being open-source means tech-savvy users may self-host instead of paying.
2. Niche market — total addressable market may cap out smaller than trades markets.
3. Vertical-specific workflows (allergen tracking for food, batch lot tracing for cosmetics) add complexity.

### 9. Pressure Washing & Auto Detailing Booking + CRM — Score: 83/105

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | Jobber/HCP serve generically. $2.3B+ pressure washing, $15B+ detailing. No dedicated tool yet. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Generic tools don't handle sqft-based pricing, before/after photos, property-specific workflows. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $59-79 LTD. Simple product, low infrastructure costs. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | No dedicated free tier for this niche. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | r/pressurewashing (100K+), r/AutoDetailing (500K+), r/sweatystartup. Excellent reach. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "Pressure washing software", "auto detailing CRM". Growing keywords, low competition. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Niche audience on AppSumo. Sweaty startup overlap helps. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Active communities would leave reviews. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | Limited upsell — niche stays focused. Multi-location or franchise tier as MRR. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Booking + CRM + photos + invoicing. Very achievable in 3-4 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Pressure washing = deeply boring sweaty startup. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Verdict**: BUILD (fast, focused, niche)
**Next Steps**:
1. Build mobile-first: instant quote calculator (sqft > price), booking with packages, before/after photos, invoicing.
2. GPS-stamped job completion for proof of service.
3. Launch in r/pressurewashing and r/sweatystartup at $59-79 LTD.

**Risks**:
1. Niche may be too small for $10K+ MRR without expanding to adjacent services.
2. Generic FSM tools are "good enough" for some operators.

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | SimplePractice raised $370M. TherapyNotes profitable. 400K+ licensed counselors. Massive market. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | SimplePractice $49-99/mo growing more complex. Built for growing practices, not solo. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $99 LTD possible. AI note generation has ongoing API costs — need hybrid pricing. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | No major free tier. Therapists willing to pay for practice tools. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | r/therapists, r/psychotherapy, r/privatepractice. Decent but smaller communities. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "SimplePractice alternative", "therapist billing software". Good niche content. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Healthcare SaaS is less typical AppSumo. HIPAA adds friction. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Therapists are engaged professionals who leave reviews. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | AI note generation (usage-based), group practice upgrade, insurance integration premium. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | HIPAA compliance adds complexity. E-signature, billing, AI notes. Tight for 4-6 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Unglamorous professional service. Not blue-collar but solidly boring. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Verdict**: BUILD (with HIPAA expertise on team)
**Next Steps**:
1. Build HIPAA-compliant, stripped-down practice tool: AI SOAP notes, calendar, reminders, Stripe billing, superbill generation.
2. AI note-taking that saves 30+ min/day is the killer feature.
3. Launch at $99 LTD for solo license. AI notes as usage-based add-on.

**Risks**:
1. HIPAA compliance requires specific technical and legal expertise.
2. SimplePractice has massive brand recognition and $370M in funding.
3. Insurance integration is complex and varies by state.

### 11. Niche Review Management for Single-Location Businesses — Score: 82/105

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Podium ($249+/mo), Birdeye ($299+/mo), BrightLocal exist. $1.5B+ market. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | All enterprise-oriented or overpriced for single-location. Weave $300+/mo is overkill. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | $59-79 LTD. API costs to Google/Yelp are cheap. Very profitable. |
| No Free Tier | 2/5 | 1x | 2 | Google sends review notifications for free. Basic monitoring is free. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | r/sweatystartup, r/smallbusiness. Cross-industry appeal. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | 1x | 5 | "Get more Google reviews", "review management for small business". High volume. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Clear ROI for any service business. Good AppSumo fit. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | Review tool users would leave reviews. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | 3x | 9 | Limited upsell for single-location. Multi-location as MRR path. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | SMS automation + review aggregation + alerts. Very simple. 2-3 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | General small business tool, not industry-specific. Less boring. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER — may work better as a feature within trade-specific tools than standalone.
**Next Steps**:
1. Build focused review tool: post-service SMS > review link > monitoring dashboard > negative alert > response templates.
2. Price at $19-29/mo or $59-79 LTD.
3. Consider bundling as a feature with FSM or cleaning tools instead of standalone.

**Risks**:
1. Google API changes could break review monitoring.
2. Very simple product — easy for competitors to replicate.
3. May work better as a feature within FSM/CRM tools than a standalone product.

| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Enterprise TMS $5K-50K. AscendTMS limited compliance. Samsara/Motive $35+/truck/mo + hardware. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $99 LTD per fleet (up to 5 trucks). IFTA calculation is self-contained. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | AscendTMS free tier limited. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | r/trucking (200K+), r/logistics. Active but industry-specific. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "IFTA calculator", "trucking compliance." Seasonal content around filing deadlines. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Very niche AppSumo audience. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | 1x | 3 | Smaller, niche audience. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Per-truck pricing for larger fleets, ELD integration, advanced compliance. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | IFTA, DOT compliance, driver documents. Domain-specific complexity. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Trucking compliance = deeply boring. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Next Steps**:
1. Build compliance-first dashboard: driver documents, IFTA auto-calculation, maintenance scheduling, DOT audit prep.
2. Launch before quarterly IFTA filing deadlines for maximum urgency.
3. No hardware required — works with any existing ELD.

**Risks**:
1. Trucking compliance requires deep domain knowledge.
2. Competition from Truckbase (modern, funded) and AscendTMS (free, 57K companies).

| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Cornerstone crashes, click-heavy. Weave expensive/overkill. DaySmart "difficult reminders." |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | $79-99 LTD per practice. SMS costs manageable. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | No free vet communication tools. |
| Channel Access | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | r/veterinary (100K+), r/VetTech. Smaller. More reliant on conferences. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | 1x | 4 | "Vet recall software", "pet appointment reminders." Niche but targetable. |

| MRR Path | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Per-practice SMS usage, premium integrations, multi-location. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | SMS + recall + reviews. Well-scoped for 3-4 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | Unglamorous professional service. |

**Must-Have Filters**: All pass
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Next Steps**:
1. Build communication add-on for any vet PMS: 2-way SMS, vaccine recall, prescription refill alerts, review requests.
2. Pet-specific templates ("Buddy is due for his rabies booster!").
3. Integrate via CSV or API with Cornerstone, ezyVet, Shepherd.

**Risks**:
1. PMS vendors could build native communication.
2. Small addressable market (32K practices).

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 3x | 12 | Applied Epic ($1,100+/mo), AMS360, EZLynx all proven. 400K+ agents, 36K+ agencies. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | 2x | 10 | Every incumbent UI is "old", "clunky", "antiquated." Small agents are ignored. |
| LTD Viability | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | $79-99 LTD for CRM portion. Carrier integrations need MRR. |

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Next Steps**:
1. Build lightweight tracker: client DB, policy details, renewal pipeline with 60/30/15-day alerts.

**Risks**:
1. Insurance is heavily regulated. Carrier integrations are gatekept.
2. Hard to reach agents — fragmented channels.

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Next Steps**:
1. Build dental communication add-on: recall campaigns, appointment confirmations, review requests.

### 16. Small Business Bookkeeping Simplifier — Score: 75/105

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 3x | 15 | QBO 7M+ subscribers. Xero, Wave, FreshBooks proven. 33M+ small businesses. |
| Competitor Weakness | 2/5 | 2x | 4 | Wave is free and decent. QBO dominant. Hard to beat established players. |
| LTD Viability | 3/5 | 2x | 6 | Bank connections (Plaid) have ongoing costs. |
| No Free Tier | 1/5 | 1x | 1 | Wave is free. QBO has cheap tiers. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | 2x | 8 | r/smallbusiness, r/accounting, r/Bookkeeping. |

**Must-Have Filters**: Pass with caution — QBO is dominant but beatable at the low end.
**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER (high risk, high reward)
**Next Steps**:
1. Validate AI-first bookkeeping for non-accountants vs. Wave (free) and Xero (good).
2. Consider trade-specific bookkeeping (e.g., "Bookkeeping for HVAC contractors") to differentiate.

**Risks**:
1. Competing with free (Wave) and dominant (QBO) is extremely difficult.
2. Bank integration costs and reliability challenges.
3. Regulatory requirements for financial software.

## Tier 2: Worth Exploring (Score 55-74)

| Idea | Score | One-Line Reason |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Salon & Barbershop Management | 74 | Crowded market with free options (Fresha, Square). Hard to differentiate. |
| E-Invoicing & Compliance for SMBs | 72 | Regulatory deadlines create urgency but major players (Xero, QBO) adding compliance. Better as a feature. |
| Locksmith CRM & Dispatch | 71 | 25K+ locksmiths but market may be too small. Revisit as vertical within FSM. |
| Freelancer Client Onboarding Portal | 71 | Content Snare validates concept but tech-adjacent, not boring enough. HoneyBook/Dubsado compete. |
| Craft Brewery Inventory | 70 | Ekos/Orchestrated serve market. Subsumed by Small-Batch Manufacturing idea (#8). |
| Franchise & Multi-Location Tools | 66 | FranConnect dominates. Per-location economics kill LTD. Too complex for MVP. |
| White-Collar-to-Trades Migration Toolkit | 65 | Real trend but no commercial validation. Better as marketing angle for FSM tools. |
| Daycare Daily Report Automation | 63 | Brightwheel well-funded, well-reviewed. Insufficient competitive gap. |
| Municipal Grant Writing | 62 | $3B opportunity but B2G sales cycles, no LTD fit, wrong AppSumo audience. |

## Tier 3: Weak / Pass (Score <55)

No ideas scored below 55. The boring business thesis is structurally sound — all evaluated opportunities have some merit. The differentiation is in execution priority and team fit.

## Top 3 Recommendations

### 1. **Field Service Management for Solo/Micro Trades** — Score: 102/105
> "The anti-ServiceTitan: dead-simple quote > schedule > invoice > get-paid for the 1-5 person trades shop."

The strongest signal across all 15 raw files. Every data source converges on this opportunity. ServiceTitan's $772M ARR proves the market. Their explicit abandonment of <3-technician shops creates a vacuum. Zero FSM tools exist on AppSumo. The $79 LTD replaces $468-$4,740 in 5-year subscription costs. Mobile-first, offline-capable, no per-user fees.

### 2. **Cleaning Service Management** — Score: 97/105
> "Flat-rate cleaning business OS: scheduling + invoicing + team chat + checklists for $79 one-time."

Onedesk's $100K+ MRR in 10 months proves the model. ZenMaid's per-seat pricing ($24/seat) is universally hated. r/EntrepreneurRideAlong has thousands of cleaning business owners seeking affordable software. Bilingual English/Spanish from day one.

### 3. **Landscaping & Lawn Care Business OS** — Score: 93/105
> "Lawn-care-specific CRM with satellite quoting, chemical tracking, and seasonal scheduling for $79-99 one-time."

600K+ landscaping businesses, $130B industry. LawnSite.com forums actively requesting CRM replacements. Copilot CRM "fairly buggy mess." No purpose-built lawn care tool at affordable price. Seasonal Feb-Mar launch window creates natural conversion lever.

## Cross-Cutting Patterns

### Universal Pain Points Across All Categories
1. **Per-user/per-seat pricing is universally hated.** Flat-rate pricing is a repeatable competitive weapon.
2. **QuickBooks integration is table stakes but universally broken.** Reliable sync is a genuine moat.
3. **Customer support degrades as companies scale.** Responsive human support is a repeatable advantage.
4. **No lifetime deals exist in any of these categories.** LTD is genuine white space across all markets.
5. **Mobile-first is expected but rarely delivered well.** Mobile app quality is a consistent differentiator.
6. **"Your competition is Excel."** Most underserved operators use spreadsheets, not competing software.

### The Winning Formula
- $29-99/mo flat rate OR $59-$499 lifetime deal
- All-in-one basics included (no add-on creep)
- Mobile-first, offline-capable
- No contracts, transparent pricing
- Responsive human support
- AI at small-business price points (not enterprise-only)
- Opinionated for one specific trade (not generic)
