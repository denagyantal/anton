## Tier 1: Strong Opportunities (Score 75+)

### 1. Field Service Management for Small Trades — Score: 100/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | $5.64B market, ServiceTitan at $772M ARR proves massive demand. 3M+ trade businesses in the US. Multiple competitors with paying customers. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | ServiceTitan 1.8/5 PissedConsumer, $39K cancellation fees, "not optimized for <3 techs." HCP add-on creep, Jobber QB sync breaks. Android apps universally terrible. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | $79 LTD replaces $50-150/mo. Trades hate monthly fees. AppSumo field service launches consistently perform well. |
| No Free Tier | 5/5 | Trades operators already pay $50-500/mo for software. Willingness to pay from day 1 is proven. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | r/HVAC, r/plumbing, r/electricians, HVAC-Talk forums, trade Facebook groups, local associations (PHCC, ACCA). Extremely active communities. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | "ServiceTitan alternative", "[trade] software for small business", comparison pages — massive SEO opportunity with high commercial intent. |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | "Anti-ServiceTitan" positioning. Small service businesses are core AppSumo audience. "Stop paying $150/mo" messaging converts. |
| Review Potential | 5/5 | Trades operators are vocal. ServiceTitan's negative reviews prove willingness to share opinions. G2/Capterra reviews flow naturally. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | Clear LTD → subscription at higher tiers. Usage-based upsells (AI scheduling, advanced reporting). Per-additional-tech pricing for growing teams. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Scheduling + invoicing + CRM + payments. Standard SaaS patterns. MVP in 4-6 weeks with mobile-first design. Offline mode adds complexity but is achievable. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Peak boring — plumbing, HVAC, electrical. VCs ignore this segment. Non-technical customers. Outdated/overpriced incumbents. Real budgets. Low churn. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Pick primary trade vertical (HVAC vs plumbing vs electrical) for V1 templates, (2) Build mobile-first MVP: scheduling, invoicing, payments, customer CRM, (3) Pre-launch on r/HVAC and trade Facebook groups, (4) Prepare AppSumo LTD at $79
**Risks**: (1) Feature expectations from ServiceTitan defectors may be too high, (2) Offline-first architecture is technically complex, (3) Jobber/HCP may cut prices in response to competitive pressure

### 2. Property Management for Small Landlords — Score: 96/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | $5.88B market. Micasa (621 HN pts), Propbox (520 HN pts), IH DIY landlord stack — 3 independent validations. 40%+ still on spreadsheets. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | AppFolio requires 50+ units. Buildium $11.60/unit for 5 units. RentRedi $6,750 diverted. DoorLoop 47% price hike. Payment failures across the board. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | $79 LTD replaces $58-139/mo. Real estate investors are deal-hunters by nature. BiggerPockets audience loves one-time pricing. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Free tools exist (Avail, TurboTenant, Innago) but each has critical gaps. Paid tier justified by reliability + AI features. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | BiggerPockets (THE #1 landlord community), r/landlord, r/realestateinvesting, REIA meetups. Extremely engaged communities. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | "Property management software for small landlords", "Buildium alternative", "landlord software" — high-intent SEO keywords. |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | Real estate investors are natural deal-hunters. "$79 LTD replacing $30-70/mo recurring" is an easy sell. "Replace your spreadsheet in 15 minutes." |
| Review Potential | 5/5 | Landlords share tools on BiggerPockets forums constantly. Reviews flow naturally from a community that actively recommends software. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for base → MRR for premium (AI features, tenant screening, advanced reporting). Per-unit pricing for growing portfolios. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Rent collection + lease management + maintenance + basic accounting. Stripe/Plaid for payments, e-signature APIs. MVP in 4-6 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | Unglamorous property management. VCs ignore small landlords. Non-technical customers. Legacy software is overpriced. Real budgets. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build MVP: rent collection, lease management, maintenance requests, expense tracking for taxes, (2) Validate on BiggerPockets forums, (3) Add AI expense categorization + Schedule E export as differentiator, (4) Launch LTD at $79 targeting 5-50 unit landlords
**Risks**: (1) Payment processing reliability is table stakes and complex, (2) Free competitors (Avail, Innago) create price pressure, (3) State-specific legal compliance (lease templates, eviction rules) requires broad research

### 3. Cleaning Service Management — Score: 94/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | $1.98B market growing 10.2% CAGR. ZenMaid $3M/yr ARR. Onedesk $100K+ MRR. Only 43% use end-to-end software. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | ZenMaid per-seat creep ($24/seat), chat-only support, mobile "90% crippled." Swept janitorial-only. MaidCentral $450/mo overkill. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | $69 LTD replaces $100-170/mo of ZenMaid + Gusto + WhatsApp. Cleaning is one of the most popular "first business" categories. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | BookingKoala has free plan, Connecteam free under 10 employees. But cleaning-specific all-in-one at flat rate has clear paid value. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | r/CleaningBusiness, r/EntrepreneurRideAlong (cleaning hugely popular), ISSA, cleaning Facebook groups (100K+ members). |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | "Best cleaning business software", "ZenMaid alternative", "cleaning business CRM" — strong SEO with commercial intent. |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | Cleaning is a top "first business" category. Huge audience of new/solo operators. "Built for cleaners, not enterprises." |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | Cleaning business owners share recommendations in Facebook groups. G2/Capterra reviews will come from active community. |
| MRR Path | 5/5 | LTD for solo → subscription for teams. Usage-based: payroll processing, SMS credits, client portal seats. Natural upsell path. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Scheduling + invoicing + team chat + checklists + client portal. Standard SaaS. MVP in 4-6 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Peak boring — residential and commercial cleaning. VCs ignore. Non-technical customers. High switching costs once adopted. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build cleaning-specific MVP: scheduling, invoicing, team coordination (replace WhatsApp), cleaning checklists with photo proof, (2) Add bilingual English/Spanish from day one, (3) Target r/EntrepreneurRideAlong and cleaning Facebook groups, (4) Launch LTD at $69
**Risks**: (1) ZenMaid has strong community (3,000+ owners) and brand loyalty, (2) Per-seat pricing is more profitable — flat rate may limit revenue, (3) Cleaning business churn is higher than trades

### 4. Review & Reputation Management for Single-Location Businesses — Score: 92/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | $1.5B+ market. Podium ($249+/mo), Birdeye ($299+/mo), Weave ($300+/mo) prove massive willingness to pay. 90% of consumers read reviews. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | All enterprise-priced ($249-300+/mo). Weave bundles overkill features. No affordable tool for single-location plumber or dentist. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | $59-79 LTD. Low ongoing API costs. One extra 5-star review worth hundreds in new business. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Google Business Profile is free but no automation. Paid tier justified by automated review collection. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | Every trade subreddit discusses getting more Google reviews. Cross-industry appeal. Facebook groups for every service business. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Review management for [trade]", "get more Google reviews", "reputation management software" — solid SEO but competitive. |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | Universal appeal across service businesses. Clear, simple value proposition. "$59 to get more 5-star reviews." |
| Review Potential | 5/5 | Meta — a review management tool's users are review-savvy by definition. Reviews beget reviews. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for base → MRR for AI response drafts, multi-platform monitoring, advanced analytics. SMS credits as usage-based upsell. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Google/Yelp/Facebook API integration, SMS sending via Twilio, simple dashboard. MVP in 3-4 weeks. Lightweight to build. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | Serves boring businesses (trades, dental, restaurants) but the tool itself is marketing-adjacent. Still underserved at the single-location level. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build MVP: automated post-service SMS review request, review monitoring dashboard (Google + Yelp + Facebook), negative review alerts, (2) Target trades businesses first, (3) Launch LTD at $59-79 on AppSumo, (4) Expand to dental, vet, restaurants
**Risks**: (1) Google API restrictions may limit functionality, (2) Podium/Birdeye may create downmarket tiers, (3) Low switching costs — easy for customers to leave

### 5. Landscaping & Lawn Care Management — Score: 90/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | $130B+ industry. 600K+ businesses. Yardbook, Jobber, SingleOps prove paying market. LawnSite forums running active software recommendation threads. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | Jobber 3/5 on support, lacks lawn-specific features. Copilot CRM "fairly buggy." SingleOps enterprise pricing. Yardbook free but dated UI. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | $79-99 LTD. Perfect timing for Feb-Mar launch when lawn care businesses gear up for season. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Yardbook is free (dated). Paid tier justified by lawn-specific features (chemical tracking, seasonal scheduling, route optimization). |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | r/lawncare (500K+ members), r/landscaping, LawnSite.com forums, landscaping Facebook groups. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Lawn care software", "landscaping CRM", "lawn care business app" — good SEO opportunity with seasonal spikes. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | Lawn care is a popular sweaty startup. LTD resonates with cost-conscious operators. Seasonal launch timing boosts conversion. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | LawnSite.com and Facebook groups provide organic word-of-mouth. Trade-specific communities will share reviews. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for solo → subscription for multi-crew teams. Upsell: chemical compliance tracking, advanced route optimization, snow removal module. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Scheduling + quoting (satellite measurement) + invoicing + route optimization + chemical tracking. MVP in 4-6 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Peak boring — lawn mowing and landscaping. VCs completely ignore. Non-technical operators. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build lawn-specific MVP: property-size quoting, seasonal scheduling, chemical tracking, route optimization, (2) Launch Feb-Mar aligned with season start, (3) Target LawnSite.com and r/lawncare, (4) LTD at $79-99
**Risks**: (1) Seasonal revenue pattern — summer heavy, winter light, (2) Yardbook's free tier creates conversion friction, (3) Jobber is a strong generalist competitor

### 6. Pressure Washing & Auto Detailing Booking + CRM — Score: 89/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | Pressure washing $2.3B+ market. Auto detailing $15B+. Both growing rapidly. r/pressurewashing 100K+ members, r/AutoDetailing 500K+. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | Zero purpose-built tools. Generic FSM (Jobber, HCP) don't handle sqft-based pricing, before/after photos, or property-specific workflows. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $59-79 LTD. Low-cost operators are price-sensitive but tool directly replaces messy text-message-and-notebook workflow. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Most operators use text messages and paper. Any paid tool needs to clearly beat the free alternative (phone + notebook). |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | r/pressurewashing, r/AutoDetailing, r/sweatystartup. Both are r/sweatystartup's favorite recommendations. Facebook groups very active. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Pressure washing software", "auto detailing booking app", "pressure washing CRM" — low competition SEO. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | Sweaty startup audience on AppSumo. Clear value prop. Low price point fits LTD model perfectly. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | Passionate communities will share reviews organically. Before/after photo documentation is inherently shareable. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for base → MRR for payment processing margin, SMS credits, fleet/multi-truck operations. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Booking + sqft-based quoting + invoicing + photo documentation. Simple SaaS. MVP in 3-4 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Peak sweaty/boring. Pressure washing and auto detailing are classic blue-collar businesses. Zero VC interest. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build mobile-first MVP: instant quote calculator (sqft/vehicle size), booking, before/after photo documentation, invoicing, (2) Target r/pressurewashing and r/sweatystartup, (3) LTD at $59-79
**Risks**: (1) Very small businesses may resist any paid tool, (2) Seasonal in some regions, (3) Low ARPU ceiling

### 7. Contractor Quoting & Estimation Tool — Score: 88/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 73% of electrical contractors prioritize estimating. 3M+ trade contractors in the US. Multiple HN Show HNs (InstaBuild, QuoteCreator, Compare Contractor Quotes) validate demand. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | ConEst $275+/mo, commercial-focused. Jobber basic quoting only. No affordable trade-specific tool for residential operators quoting $500-25K jobs. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $69-89 LTD. One extra job won from faster quoting pays for the tool. Spring launch timing aligns with renovation season. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Some use paper estimates. Paid tool justified by professional appearance and speed. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | r/electricians (200K+), r/HVAC, r/Plumbing, ElectricianTalk forums. Active communities discussing estimating workflows. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Contractor estimating app", "electrical estimating software", "[trade] quote software" — strong SEO with commercial intent. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | Trades operators love one-time purchases. "Quote from your truck, email before you leave" positioning works. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | Contractors who win more jobs from faster quoting will become vocal advocates. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for base → MRR for live material pricing feeds, advanced proposal templates, multi-user collaboration. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Pre-built job templates + labor calculator + PDF generation + e-signature. MVP in 3-4 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Peak boring — residential trades estimating. Paper-to-digital transition still happening. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build trade-specific templates (panel upgrades, water heater, AC replacement, EV charger), (2) Mobile-first with offline capability, (3) "Good/better/best" option generator for upselling, (4) Launch spring with $69-89 LTD
**Risks**: (1) Material pricing databases are complex and vary regionally, (2) Each trade has different estimating workflows, (3) Jobber/HCP may improve quoting features

### 8. Auto Repair Shop Management — Score: 87/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | $3.4B market → $8.6B by 2033. 303K auto mechanic businesses. Tekmetric ($179+), Shopmonkey, Shop-Ware all have paying customers. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | Shopmonkey "STAY AWAY, NO customer support." AutoLeap "Stay Away!!!" Tekmetric QB $10K discrepancy. Mitchell 1 "jumbled mess." Massive $65-179 pricing gap. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $99 LTD replaces $179-299/mo. Auto repair is a classic boring business. Strong value proposition. |
| No Free Tier | 5/5 | ARI exists at $20/mo but too basic. Full-featured tools start at $179/mo. Clear willingness to pay. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | r/MechanicAdvice, Diagnostic Network forums, Garage Journal, AutoShopOwner.com, ASA. Active but slightly smaller than trades. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Mitchell 1 alternative", "Tekmetric alternative", "auto repair shop software" — strong comparison SEO. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | Auto repair is a classic boring business. Shop owners are price-sensitive. "Affordable Tekmetric alternative" positioning. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | Auto shop owners are vocal on Diagnostic Network and Capterra. Reviews will come naturally. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for base → MRR for DVI, parts ordering integration, advanced reporting. Mobile mechanic mode as premium feature. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | Estimates, ROs, invoicing, DVI, customer texting, QB sync. More complex than simple FSM — DVI and parts integration add scope. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Peak boring — auto repair shops. VCs ignore. Non-technical shop owners. Legacy software dominates. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build MVP: estimates, repair orders, invoicing, customer 2-way SMS, basic DVI, (2) Target $75-125/mo sweet spot filling the pricing gap, (3) Target Diagnostic Network and Garage Journal forums, (4) LTD at $99
**Risks**: (1) DVI (Digital Vehicle Inspection) is expected — significant dev effort, (2) Parts catalog integration is complex, (3) Mitchell 1/ALLDATA have deep data moats

### 9. Dental Practice Patient Communication — Score: 87/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | $2.9B dental PM software market → $6.7B by 2035. 200K+ dental practices. Weave is a $1B+ company proving massive demand. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | Weave $300+/mo, RevenueWell $300+/mo — all enterprise-priced. DaySmart Vet "difficult reminder system." CareStack "glitchy." No affordable add-on. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $79-99 LTD per practice. Recovering 2-3 no-shows pays for tool permanently. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Some PMS have basic reminders built in. Standalone add-on must clearly outperform. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | r/dentistry, dental forums, dental conferences. Professional communities but smaller than trades subreddits. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Dental patient recall software", "reduce dental no-shows", "Weave alternative" — strong commercial intent. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | Dental practices have real budgets. "$79 to recover thousands in missed appointments" is compelling. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | Dental practice managers share tools within professional networks. |
| MRR Path | 5/5 | LTD for recall → MRR for full patient communication suite, AI insurance verification, multi-location support. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | SMS/email automation + PMS integration (Dentrix, Eaglesoft, Open Dental). PMS integration via CSV or API adds complexity. HIPAA compliance required. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | Unglamorous professional services. Dental offices are deeply boring. VCs focused on clinical AI, not practice ops. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build recall add-on: automated multi-channel reminders, no-show rebooking, waitlist management, (2) Integrate with Dentrix/Eaglesoft/Open Dental, (3) Expand to vet and optometry, (4) LTD at $79-99
**Risks**: (1) HIPAA compliance adds development complexity, (2) PMS integration is fragmented — each system is different, (3) Weave is well-funded and may create downmarket tier

### 10. Salon & Barbershop Management — Score: 85/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 1M+ salons in the US. Average salon spends $200-400/mo on software. DaySmart, Fresha, Vagaro all have paying customers. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | Industry actively resists technology. Digital consultation (reference photos, stylist annotations) hasn't been digitized. Miscommunication is #1 pain point. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $69-89 LTD. Salon owners are price-sensitive but spend $200-400/mo currently. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Fresha has free tier. Differentiation through consultation workflow and industry-specific features. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | Salon/barber Facebook groups, Instagram communities, beauty industry forums. Less Reddit presence. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Salon management software", "barbershop booking app", "salon CRM" — decent SEO but competitive. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | Beauty/personal care businesses are active on deal platforms. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | Salon owners are social media active and share recommendations. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for booking/CRM → MRR for payment processing, advanced marketing, multi-stylist scheduling. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Booking + client profiles + consultation photos + invoicing. Standard patterns. MVP in 4-5 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | Unglamorous local services. VCs largely ignore. Non-technical customers. Tech-resistant market = low competition. |

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Next Steps**: (1) Validate consultation workflow pain point with 10-15 salon owner interviews, (2) Research Fresha/Vagaro competitive positioning, (3) If validated, build consultation-first MVP
**Risks**: (1) Tech-resistant market makes distribution harder, (2) Fresha's free tier is hard to compete with, (3) Instagram/social-heavy distribution is different from trade forums

### 11. Construction Management for Small Contractors — Score: 84/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | $16.62B construction software market by 2030. InstaBuild, Buildbite, Planera all targeting this space. Repeated Show HN attempts prove demand. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | Procore/Buildertrend $300+/mo — enterprise. Generic invoicing doesn't understand progress billing, retainage, change orders. Massive gap. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $99-149 LTD vs $300+/mo Procore is compelling. Contractors hate monthly fees. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Paper invoices are the "free tier." Tool must clearly beat paper + phone camera + text messages. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | Trade forums, r/Construction, contractor Facebook groups. Active but fragmented communities. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Construction invoicing app", "contractor project management", "simple construction software" — strong long-tail SEO. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | Contractors buy tools. Construction-specific invoicing resonates. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | Contractors who get paid faster become vocal advocates. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for invoicing → MRR for project management, subcontractor coordination, permit tracking. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | Progress billing, change orders, retainage add construction-specific complexity beyond basic invoicing. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Peak boring — construction subcontractors still using paper. VCs ignore small contractors. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build construction-specific invoicing MVP: progress billing, change order tracking, payment reminders, (2) Mobile-first for jobsite use, (3) Target contractor Facebook groups and trade forums, (4) LTD at $99
**Risks**: (1) Construction workflows vary widely by trade specialty, (2) Multiple failed attempts (InstaBuild, QuotationGenie) suggest execution is hard, (3) Procore has massive brand awareness

### 12. Compliance & Licensing Tracker for Trades — Score: 83/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | OSHA penalty changes July 2025. UK MTD April 2026. E-invoicing mandates spreading. Government forms software doing $30M/yr ARR proves compliance demand. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | SafetyCulture targets enterprise. Drata/Vanta $7K-10K+/yr for tech companies. No affordable compliance tool for a 3-person plumbing shop. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | $99-149 LTD. "Stop worrying about OSHA fines" drives conversion. Fear-of-fines messaging is powerful. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | No free tools exist for trade-specific compliance. Willingness to pay driven by regulatory fear. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | Trade subreddits, contractor forums, safety-focused communities. OSHA deadline-driven marketing. |
| Content Potential | 5/5 | "OSHA requirements for [trade]", "contractor license requirements [state]", "compliance software for contractors" — high-intent, low-competition SEO. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | Compliance tools have proven LTD demand. Fear-driven purchase = high conversion. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | Compliance tools are used but rarely talked about. Lower word-of-mouth potential. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for base checklist → MRR for ongoing updates, multi-state tracking, employee certification management. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | Compliance checklist + reminder system + document storage. State-by-state data collection is the hardest part. MVP for one state + one trade in 2-3 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Compliance is the most boring possible category. Nobody wants to build this = minimal competition. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Start with one state + one trade (e.g., California HVAC), (2) Build compliance checklist with renewal reminders, (3) Expand state-by-state and trade-by-trade, (4) LTD at $99-149
**Risks**: (1) State-by-state data collection is labor-intensive, (2) Regulatory changes require ongoing maintenance, (3) Low excitement factor makes marketing harder

### 13. Restaurant Food Cost / Invoice OCR — Score: 83/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 1M+ restaurants, 70% independent. MarketMan ($239+/mo), xtraCHEF (Toast), BlueCart all prove willingness to pay. 3-5% profit margins mean food cost tracking = survival. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | MarketMan $239+/mo. Toast overkill + hardware lock-in. No affordable standalone recipe costing tool. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $69-89 LTD. "Save $500/month by finding food cost leaks" is compelling. No ongoing API costs. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Spreadsheets are the current free option. Phone-camera OCR must clearly beat manual entry. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | r/restaurateur, r/KitchenConfidential (combined 1M+ members). Restaurant Facebook groups. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Restaurant food cost software", "recipe costing tool", "food cost calculator" — good SEO with commercial intent. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | Restaurant owners are price-sensitive. "Save $500/month" positioning works on AppSumo. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | Restaurant owners share recommendations but are less active on review platforms than trades. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for recipe costing → MRR for supplier invoice OCR, inventory management, multi-location support. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | Recipe database + cost calculations + invoice OCR (phone camera). OCR accuracy is the technical challenge. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Independent restaurants are deeply boring. VCs target Toast/Square, not indie restaurant tools. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build standalone recipe costing MVP: input recipes, link ingredient costs, auto-calculate food cost per dish, (2) Add phone-camera invoice OCR for auto-updating prices, (3) Target r/restaurateur and r/KitchenConfidential, (4) LTD at $69-89
**Risks**: (1) OCR accuracy for handwritten/varied invoice formats, (2) Restaurant industry has high business failure rate = churn, (3) Toast expanding into this space with xtraCHEF

### 14. Micro-Bakery / Food Production Management — Score: 83/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | Craftplan Show HN: 577 upvotes, 167 comments — extraordinary for a niche tool. 700K+ cottage food businesses in US. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | Enterprise production management built for factories. No affordable tool for micro-bakeries, cottage food, small catering. Craftplan is open-source with no commercial model. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $99-149 LTD. Food producers would pay to replace spreadsheets. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | Craftplan is free/open-source. Commercial version must add significant value (online ordering, compliance, mobile). |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | Cottage food Facebook groups, home baker communities, food business forums. Niche but passionate. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Bakery management software", "cottage food business tools", "recipe management for small producers" — low competition SEO. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | Food business owners are budget-conscious. Clear value proposition for a niche audience. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | Food business community is tight-knit and shares recommendations. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for recipe/inventory → MRR for online ordering, delivery scheduling, multi-location, compliance tracking. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Recipe management + inventory + order tracking + batch planning. Craftplan proves it's buildable. MVP in 4-5 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Deeply boring — micro-bakeries, cottage food. Zero VC interest. Non-technical customers using paper. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Study Craftplan's open-source codebase for workflow insights, (2) Build commercial SaaS: recipes with costing, inventory with lot tracking, order management, (3) Add state-specific cottage food compliance, (4) LTD at $99-149
**Risks**: (1) Craftplan is free/open-source competitor, (2) Very niche market — TAM may be limited, (3) Cottage food laws vary by state

### 15. Tax Professional Workflow Manager — Score: 82/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 300K+ tax preparers. TaxDome ($50-100/user/mo), Canopy ($40-79/user/mo) prove market. 61.5% dissatisfaction with pricing. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | TaxDome/Canopy expensive for solo preparers. Drake's interface "clunky." ATX requires 16 GB RAM. All priced for growing firms. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $79-99 LTD for solo preparer license. Tax pros buy once per season. October-November launch timing. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Email + spreadsheets are the free alternative. Paid tool justified by client document collection automation. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | r/taxpros (40K+), TaxProTalk forums, accounting communities. Seasonal engagement spikes Oct-Apr. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "TaxDome alternative", "tax preparer client portal", "CPA document collection" — seasonal but high-intent SEO. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | Niche audience but strong willingness to pay. Seasonal product may limit AppSumo performance. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | Tax professionals share tools on forums and in professional networks. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for portal → MRR for advanced workflows, multi-preparer collaboration, tax software integration. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Client portal + document upload + reminders + e-signature + status tracking. MVP in 3-4 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Tax preparation is deeply boring. Non-technical preparers. Outdated tools. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build client portal MVP: branded upload page, checklist reminders, secure messaging, e-signature, (2) Integrate with Drake/Lacerte, (3) Launch October-November, (4) LTD at $79-99
**Risks**: (1) Highly seasonal (Oct-Apr), (2) TaxDome has significant momentum, (3) Tax preparers are resistant to changing established workflows

### 16. Insurance Agent CRM — Score: 81/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 400K+ licensed agents, 36K+ agencies. Applied Epic $1,100+/mo for 7 users. Independent channel writes 60%+ of P&C premiums. |
| Competitor Weakness | 5/5 | Applied Epic "UI looks old, too many clicks." AMS360 "outdated design." EZLynx "notoriously poor support." TAM "clunky, antiquated and glitchy." |
| LTD Viability | 3/5 | $79-99 LTD for CRM/tracker. Full carrier integrations require MRR. Partial LTD viability. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Most agents use spreadsheets. Paid tool justified by renewal tracking automation. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | Insurance Forums (dozens of pages debating AMS), r/Insurance. Professional but smaller communities. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Applied Epic alternative", "insurance agency management software", "insurance CRM" — professional-intent SEO. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | Niche professional audience. Less natural AppSumo fit than trades. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | Insurance professionals share on forums but less review-driven than trades. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for lightweight CRM → MRR for carrier integrations, ACORD form auto-fill, commission tracking. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | Client DB + renewal pipeline + communication log + ACORD forms. ACORD form auto-fill adds complexity. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Insurance agencies are deeply boring. Legacy vendors haven't innovated in a decade. VCs ignore. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build lightweight CRM: client database, renewal pipeline with alerts, communication log, (2) ACORD form auto-fill as killer feature, (3) Target Insurance Forums, (4) LTD at $79-99
**Risks**: (1) Carrier integrations are complex and vary widely, (2) Applied Systems/Vertafore have deep industry relationships, (3) Compliance requirements in insurance

### 17. Job Costing & Profitability for Trades — Score: 81/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | Every trade business needs profitability tracking. Currently buried in ServiceTitan/Jobber at premium tiers or done in spreadsheets. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | Reporting is "universally weak" across all FSM platforms. Excel export required for meaningful analysis. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $79-99 LTD. "Know your profit on every job" messaging resonates with cost-conscious operators. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Spreadsheets are the free alternative. Automated job costing must be clearly faster. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | Same trade communities as FSM — r/HVAC, r/plumbing, r/electricians. Profitability discussions are common. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Job costing for contractors", "track profit per job", "trade business profitability" — educational content potential. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | Standalone profitability tool has clear value. "Find out if you're losing money on jobs." |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | Financial tools get fewer reviews than operational tools. Less word-of-mouth potential. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for basic costing → MRR for advanced analytics, team performance tracking, integration with FSM tools. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Job tracking + material costs + labor hours + overhead allocation. Simple calculations. MVP in 3-4 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Financial tracking for trades is deeply boring. Massive gap at affordable price points. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Could be a standalone tool or a module within the FSM product (#1), (2) Build job costing MVP: track materials, labor, overhead per job, (3) Show profit margin per job type, (4) Target trade forums
**Risks**: (1) May be better as a feature of FSM rather than standalone, (2) Convincing trades operators to enter cost data consistently, (3) Limited standalone market

### 18. AI Receptionist for Trades — Score: 78/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | Elyos AI $13M Series A, Netic $43M raised ($450M valuation), Podium "Jerry 2.0" in 10K+ SMBs. Trades miss 60-80% of calls. |
| Competitor Weakness | 3/5 | Growing competition — Elyos, Avoca, Sameday AI, Newo AI. Jobber bundling AI receptionist as feature. Market commoditizing fast. |
| LTD Viability | 3/5 | Moderate — ongoing AI API costs make pure LTD tricky. Hybrid LTD (base + usage) works better. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Trades operators currently miss calls. Clear willingness to pay for call handling. |
| Channel Access | 5/5 | Same trade communities. "I miss calls while I'm under a house" is a universal pain point. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "AI answering service for [trade]", "HVAC virtual receptionist" — decent SEO but increasingly competitive. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | AI tools have LTD challenges due to ongoing costs. Hybrid pricing reduces AppSumo appeal. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | Trades operators who stop missing calls become vocal advocates. |
| MRR Path | 5/5 | Natural usage-based pricing (per call/per minute). Strong recurring revenue potential. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | Twilio/Vapi + LLM APIs. 2-3 week MVP. Trade-specific training data is the hard part. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | Serves boring trades but the tool itself is AI-forward. Platform bundling risk as Jobber/HCP add this feature. |

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Next Steps**: (1) Assess platform bundling risk — Jobber AI Receptionist may eliminate standalone market, (2) If pursuing, go ultra-niche (e.g., dental-only with insurance verification), (3) Avoid head-on competition with funded players
**Risks**: (1) Platform bundling risk — Jobber, HCP integrating AI receptionists, (2) Well-funded competitors (Elyos $13M, Netic $43M), (3) Ongoing AI API costs challenge LTD model

### 19. Solo Therapist Practice Management — Score: 78/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 400K+ licensed counselors. SimplePractice raised $370M. TherapyNotes, Jane App all prove market. Health & wellness had 656 "I wish" Reddit requests. |
| Competitor Weakness | 3/5 | SimplePractice ($49-99/mo) and TherapyNotes ($49+/mo) are established but overbuilt for solo practitioners. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $99 LTD for solo license. AI note generation as usage-based add-on. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Manual paperwork is the free alternative. HIPAA compliance makes paid tools necessary. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | r/therapists, r/psychotherapy, r/privatepractice. Professional communities but smaller than trades. |
| Content Potential | 3/5 | "SimplePractice alternative", "therapist practice management" — competitive SEO space. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | Healthcare tools have HIPAA concerns that may reduce impulse buying. Niche audience on AppSumo. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | Therapists share in professional circles but are less review-driven. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for base → MRR for AI session notes, insurance billing, group practice features. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | HIPAA compliance adds significant complexity. Scheduling + notes + billing is standard but compliance is not. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 3/5 | Professional services, not classic boring business. More tech-aware audience than trades. |

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Next Steps**: (1) Validate HIPAA compliance costs and timeline, (2) Interview solo therapists about SimplePractice pain points, (3) AI session notes as key differentiator — validate willingness to pay
**Risks**: (1) HIPAA compliance is expensive and ongoing, (2) SimplePractice has strong brand and community, (3) Insurance billing integration is complex

### 20. Small Fleet Trucking Compliance — Score: 78/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | 500K+ trucking companies, 97% <20 trucks. $875B+ market. AscendTMS at 57K+ companies proves demand. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | AscendTMS limited compliance. TruckingOffice dated UX. Samsara $35+/truck + hardware. Enterprise TMS $5K-50K to implement. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $99 LTD per fleet (up to 5 trucks). IFTA reporting alone justifies purchase before quarterly deadline. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | AscendTMS has free tier but limited compliance. Compliance urgency drives willingness to pay. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | r/trucking (200K+ members), trucking forums, truck stop communities. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "IFTA calculator", "trucking compliance software", "DOT audit preparation" — strong commercial intent. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | Niche audience. Truckers less likely on AppSumo than other trades. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | Trucking community shares tools but is smaller and more dispersed. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | LTD covers most needs for small fleet. MRR potential via load board integration, advanced dispatching. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | Compliance dashboard + IFTA calculation + document tracking. IFTA calculations are well-defined. MVP in 4-5 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Trucking compliance is deeply boring. VCs ignore small carriers. Legacy systems dominate. |

**Verdict**: BUILD
**Next Steps**: (1) Build IFTA calculator as hook, (2) Add driver document tracking with expiration alerts, (3) Launch before quarterly IFTA filing deadline, (4) Target r/trucking, (5) LTD at $99
**Risks**: (1) ELD hardware integration expectations, (2) Regulatory complexity varies by state, (3) Trucking industry is cyclical

### 21. SaaS Expense Analyzer — Score: 78/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | Zylo, Productiv, Cledara prove enterprise market ($3B+). SaaS costs per employee $9,100/yr. Reddit subscription fatigue is top-voted topic. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | All enterprise-priced ($10K+/yr). Nothing for a 5-person plumbing company auditing $800/mo in subscriptions. |
| LTD Viability | 5/5 | $59-79 LTD. Pays for itself by finding savings. "Find $500+/year in wasted subscriptions." |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | Manual bank statement review is the free alternative. Tool must surface insights automatically. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | r/smallbusiness, r/Entrepreneur, r/SaaS. Cross-industry appeal. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "SaaS spending tracker", "subscription audit tool", "reduce software costs" — growing SEO interest. |
| AppSumo Fit | 5/5 | Perfect AppSumo audience — SaaS buyers who understand subscription fatigue. Meta appeal. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | Financial tools get fewer organic reviews. Less inherently shareable. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | LTD covers core functionality. Limited upsell path beyond initial audit. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | Plaid bank connection + pattern matching + categorization. Bank connection reliability varies. MVP in 3-4 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 3/5 | Expense analysis is boring but cross-industry, not vertical. Less boring-business-specific. |

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Next Steps**: (1) Validate with Plaid integration prototype, (2) Test subscription detection accuracy, (3) Consider as feature within bookkeeping tool (#23) rather than standalone
**Risks**: (1) Plaid bank connection costs and reliability, (2) Limited repeat usage — may be a one-time audit, (3) Better as a feature than standalone product

### 22. Daycare Daily Reports — Score: 76/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 100K+ daycare centers. Brightwheel exists but enterprise-focused ($200+/mo). Parents create emotional pressure to adopt. |
| Competitor Weakness | 3/5 | Brightwheel is well-funded and established. HiMama, Lillio also compete. Small in-home providers underserved but gap narrower. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $79-129 LTD. Daycare providers are budget-conscious but parents push for modern tools. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | Paper daily sheets are free. Some basic apps exist. Paid tool must significantly improve workflow. |
| Channel Access | 3/5 | Childcare Facebook groups, daycare owner forums. Smaller, more fragmented communities than trades. |
| Content Potential | 3/5 | "Daycare management app", "childcare daily report" — niche SEO with decent intent. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | Niche audience. Less natural AppSumo fit than trades or business tools. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | Parents are vocal and share recommendations. Word-of-mouth through parent networks. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for reporting → MRR for billing/tuition tracking, parent messaging, multi-location. |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Quick-tap interface: meal, nap, diaper, activity logging + photo capture. Simple mobile app. MVP in 3-4 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | In-home daycares and small centers are deeply boring. Non-technical operators. Paper-based workflows. |

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Next Steps**: (1) Research Brightwheel competitive positioning and pricing gaps, (2) Interview in-home daycare providers, (3) If pursuing, focus on simplicity for in-home providers that Brightwheel doesn't serve well
**Risks**: (1) Brightwheel is well-funded and expanding downmarket, (2) In-home daycare providers have very small budgets, (3) Regulatory requirements (licensing, reporting) vary by state

### 23. Simple Bookkeeping / QBO Alternative — Score: 75/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 5/5 | QBO has 7M+ subscribers. Prices up 125% since 2017. 33M+ small businesses. Xero, Wave, FreshBooks all prove market. |
| Competitor Weakness | 3/5 | Xero ($15-78/mo) is a viable alternative. Wave is free. QBO backlash real but alternatives exist. Crowded. |
| LTD Viability | 3/5 | $79-99 LTD for basic tier. Bank connection as ongoing cost may require monthly fee. |
| No Free Tier | 3/5 | Wave is completely free for core features. Competing with free is hard. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | r/smallbusiness, r/Bookkeeping, r/accounting. Very active QBO complaint threads. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "QuickBooks alternative", "simple bookkeeping software" — massive search volume but highly competitive SEO. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | "Stop paying QuickBooks $200/mo" resonates strongly on AppSumo. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | Accounting tools get reviews but the market is noisy. Hard to stand out. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | Bank connection costs force some ongoing pricing. Pure LTD challenging. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | Bank feeds, auto-categorization, reconciliation, reporting. AI categorization is the differentiator but adds complexity. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | Bookkeeping is boring but the market is horizontal, not vertical. Less boring-industry-specific. |

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Next Steps**: (1) Consider vertical-izing: "QuickBooks for plumbers" or "QuickBooks for restaurants" rather than generic, (2) AI auto-categorization as key differentiator, (3) Validate whether bank connection costs allow profitable LTD
**Risks**: (1) Wave is free — hard to compete, (2) Xero is good and growing, (3) Bank connection (Plaid) costs may erode LTD margins, (4) QBO has massive moat from accountant network effects

### 24. Landscaping Chemical Tracking — Score: 75/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 600K+ landscaping businesses. EPA/state regulations mandate chemical tracking. Paper logs common but non-compliant. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | No dedicated chemical tracking tool exists. Generic FSM doesn't handle compliance requirements. |
| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $79-99 LTD. Compliance tools have high perceived value. "Avoid fines" messaging. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Paper logs are the free alternative. Digital logs with auto-weather/GPS are clearly superior. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | Landscaping communities, pest control forums. Compliance-driven marketing. |
| Content Potential | 4/5 | "Pesticide application tracking", "landscaping compliance software" — low competition, high intent. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | Niche compliance tool. Less impulse appeal than broader business tools. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | Compliance tools are used but rarely discussed publicly. |
| MRR Path | 3/5 | Limited upsell beyond core compliance tracking. May be better as module of landscaping OS (#5). |
| Build Feasibility | 5/5 | Mobile app + weather API + GPS + photo documentation + compliance reports. Simple. MVP in 2-3 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 5/5 | Chemical compliance tracking for landscapers is peak boring. Zero competition. |

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Next Steps**: (1) Better as a feature of Landscaping OS (#5) than a standalone product, (2) If standalone, validate market size and willingness to pay for compliance-only tool, (3) Research state-by-state regulatory requirements
**Risks**: (1) Very narrow niche — may be too small for standalone product, (2) Better as module within broader landscaping tool, (3) Regulatory requirements vary by state

| Market Validation | 4/5 | 32K+ vet practices. Cornerstone (IDEXX), ezyVet prove market. Pet care $150B+. |
| Competitor Weakness | 4/5 | Cornerstone crashes, click-heavy. Covetrus Pulse slow. Shepherd buggy. But IDEXX has deep moat. |
| LTD Viability | 3/5 | $149-199 LTD. Vet clinics have budgets but PMS switching is painful. |
| No Free Tier | 4/5 | Legacy software is the incumbent. No free options. |
| Channel Access | 3/5 | r/veterinary (100K+), vet conferences. Smaller, professional community. |
| Content Potential | 3/5 | "Cornerstone alternative", "vet practice software" — professional but limited search volume. |
| AppSumo Fit | 2/5 | Very niche professional tool. Not natural AppSumo audience. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | Vet professionals share within circles but small market for reviews. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | Full PMS requires subscription. LTD for wedge (prescription refills), MRR for full suite. |
| Build Feasibility | 3/5 | Full PMS is complex. Wedge product (prescription management) is simpler but limited. Medical records add complexity. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | Unglamorous professional services. VCs focus on pet tech (consumer), not practice management. |

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Risks**: IDEXX has deep vendor relationships. Full PMS is very complex. Better to start with communication add-on (covered in #9).

### 26. Digital Front Door (Booking + Payments + Reviews) — Score: 70/105

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Validation | 4/5 | 46% of small businesses have no website. Square, Calendly, Podium prove components. |
| Competitor Weakness | 3/5 | Square is good and free. Calendly works. Combining them is the pitch but individual tools are strong. |
| LTD Viability | 3/5 | Revenue from payment processing margin, not LTD. Hybrid model. |
| No Free Tier | 2/5 | Square (free), Google Business Profile (free), Calendly (free tier). Hard to beat free components. |
| Channel Access | 4/5 | Cross-industry appeal. Every trade subreddit discusses online presence. |
| Content Potential | 3/5 | "Small business booking page", "one-page business website" — competitive SEO. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | Utility tools do okay on AppSumo but not exceptional. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | Generic tools get fewer passionate reviews. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | Payment processing margin provides natural recurring revenue. |
| Build Feasibility | 4/5 | Landing page builder + Stripe + Twilio + Google API. MVP in 3-4 weeks. |
| Boring Business Bonus | 4/5 | Serves boring businesses but the tool is marketing/web — less boring itself. |

**Verdict**: EXPLORE FURTHER
**Risks**: Competing with free (Square, Calendly, Google). Each component has strong standalone tools. Better as a feature of vertical-specific tools.

| Content Potential | 3/5 | "Client onboarding portal", "document collection tool" — moderate SEO. |
| AppSumo Fit | 4/5 | Freelancers are active AppSumo buyers. Clear pain point. |
| Review Potential | 3/5 | Freelancer tools get moderate reviews. |

**Verdict**: PASS — Existing solutions (Content Snare, HoneyBook) serve this well enough. Better to verticalize within specific boring industries.

| LTD Viability | 4/5 | $149-199 LTD. Brewery owners are passionate and community-driven. |

| Content Potential | 3/5 | "Craft brewery management software", "TTB compliance" — niche SEO. |
| AppSumo Fit | 3/5 | Very niche. Limited AppSumo audience. |
| Review Potential | 4/5 | Craft brewery community is tight-knit and shares recommendations actively. |
| MRR Path | 4/5 | LTD for inventory → MRR for taproom POS, distributor features, advanced analytics. |
